## Module 1: The Wealth Mindset
Module ID: `module-1`
Description: Understand the core principles of building wealth.

### Lesson 1: Intro to Financial Literacy
Lesson ID: `lesson-1-0`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 20
Description: Why understanding money is no longer optional.

#### Screen 1: Why This Matters
Welcome to Free Finance Camp. Before we dive in, let's talk about WHY this knowledge is essential.

The modern economy doesn't just reward hard work—it rewards **ownership**.

Those who own assets (stocks, real estate, businesses, co-ops) see their wealth grow alongside the economy. Those who only earn wages often fall behind as the cost of living rises faster than their paychecks.

This isn't about blame—it's about understanding the rules of the game so you can play it.

#### Screen 2: The K-Shaped Economy
You may have heard of the **K-Shaped Recovery**. Here's what it means:

Imagine the letter 'K'. After an economic shock (like a recession or pandemic), the economy doesn't recover equally for everyone:

**The Upper Arm (going up):** Asset owners, tech workers, and investors see their wealth SOAR. Stock markets hit new highs. Home values skyrocket.

**The Lower Arm (going down):** Hourly workers, renters, and those without savings fall further behind. Jobs disappear. Rent keeps rising.

The gap between these two groups is widening every year.

#### Screen 3: Where the Wealthy Keep Their Money
Want to know the secret of the ultra-wealthy? It's not in their bank accounts.

**The top 1% hold their wealth in:**
• **Stocks & Business Equity** (~50-60%) — Ownership in companies, both public and private.
• **Real Estate** (~10-15%) — Land, commercial properties, and rental income.
• **Other Investments** (~20%) — Bonds, private equity, hedge funds.

Meanwhile, the bottom 50% hold most of their 'wealth' in:
• **Their primary home** (if they own one)
• **Cars** (which depreciate)
• **Cash in checking/savings** (losing value to inflation)

Here's the key insight: **When the stock market goes up 20%, the wealthy get 20% richer. When wages go up 3%, workers barely keep pace with inflation.**

#### Screen 4: The Wealth Gap in Numbers
The numbers are staggering:

• The **top 10%** of Americans own **93%** of all stocks.
• The **bottom 50%** own just **1%** of stocks.

This means when the S&P 500 doubles (as it did from 2019-2024), almost all of those gains went to people who were already wealthy.

**The rich get richer** because their assets (stocks, real estate) appreciate faster than wages grow.

**The poor stay poor** because they have no assets that grow—only expenses that increase.

Breaking this cycle starts with one decision: **becoming an owner, not just an earner.**

#### Screen 5: The Path to Ownership
The good news? **You can move from the bottom arm to the top.**

It starts with financial literacy: understanding how money works, how to save, and most importantly, how to **own assets**.

Assets come in many forms:
• **Stocks & ETFs** — Own a piece of publicly traded companies.
• **Real Estate** — From your first home to rental properties.
• **Co-ops & Credit Unions** — Member-owned organizations that share profits.
• **Starting a Business** — Build equity in something you control.

This course will teach you how to get started—no matter your current income level.

#### Screen 6: The Stakes Are Real
Consider this: Over the last 40 years, the S&P 500 has returned an average of ~10% per year.

Meanwhile, average wages have barely kept pace with inflation.

If you had invested just $100/month starting at age 25, by age 65 you'd have over **$500,000**. If you only saved it in a bank account? Around **$48,000**.

The difference isn't luck. It's knowledge. And that's exactly what you're here to learn.

Let's get started.

### Lesson 2: Needs vs. Wants
Lesson ID: `lesson-1-1`
Type: interactive
XP Reward: 15
Description: The foundation of all financial decisions.

#### Screen 1: The Core Principle
Money is a finite resource. To make the most of it, you need to distinguish between what you NEED and what you WANT.

**Needs** are essentials:
• Shelter (rent, mortgage)
• Food & water
• Basic clothing
• Utilities & transportation

**Wants** are extras:
• Dining out & entertainment
• New gadgets & upgrades
• Designer clothes & luxury items

#### Screen 2: The 72-Hour Rule
Pro tip: Use the **72-Hour Rule** for wants.

See something you want? Wait 72 hours before buying it.

Usually, the 'urge' fades and you save your money.

The first step to wealth is prioritizing needs, then smartly managing wants.

#### Screen 3: Global Savings Rates
How does your country compare? Personal savings rates vary dramatically around the world.

**TOP SAVERS:**
• China: ~35% — Cultural emphasis on saving
• Singapore: ~30% — Government-mandated CPF program
• Germany: ~11% — Fiscal discipline culture

**MIDDLE OF THE PACK:**
• France: ~15% — Social programs reduce need
• Japan: ~10% — Aging population drawing down

#### Screen 4: Where Does the US Stand?
**LOWER SAVERS:**
• United States: ~4-8%
• United Kingdom: ~5-7%
• Australia: ~3-5%

Why so low? Consumer culture, easy credit access, and reliance on social programs.

**The Takeaway:** Even small increases in your savings rate can dramatically impact your wealth over time. Try to save at least 20% of your income!

#### Quiz
1. Which of the following is a 'Need' vs. a 'Want'?
   - A. Netflix subscription
   - B. Groceries [Correct]
   - C. Designer shoes
   - D. Concert tickets

2. You see an expensive 'want' that wasn't in your budget. What is the best strategy to avoid an impulse buy?
   - A. Wait 24 hours
   - B. Wait 72 hours [Correct]
   - C. Wait 1 week
   - D. Buy it immediately

3. What is the first step to building wealth?
   - A. Buying stocks
   - B. Prioritizing needs over wants [Correct]
   - C. Getting a credit card
   - D. Winning the lottery

### Lesson 3: The Magic of Compound Interest
Lesson ID: `lesson-1-2`
Type: interactive
XP Reward: 20
Description: See how your money can work for you.

#### Screen 1: Simple vs Compound Interest
There are two ways your money can earn interest:

**Simple Interest** only pays you on your original deposit. If you invest $1,000 at 10% simple interest, you earn $100 every year—forever based on that original $1,000.

**Compound Interest** pays you on your original deposit AND on the interest you have already earned. That means your interest earns interest, which earns more interest.

This is why compound interest is often called the 'eighth wonder of the world.' Over time, the difference between simple and compound interest becomes enormous.

#### Screen 2: Watch It Grow: Year by Year
Here is what $1,000 looks like at 10% annual compound interest:

• **Year 1:** $1,000 → $1,100 (you earned $100)
• **Year 2:** $1,100 → $1,210 (you earned $110—interest on interest)
• **Year 5:** → $1,611
• **Year 10:** → $2,594
• **Year 20:** → $6,727
• **Year 30:** → $17,449

Notice how the growth accelerates. In the first 10 years you gained ~$1,600. In the last 10 years alone you gained over $10,700. That is the compounding snowball effect.

#### Screen 3: The Rule of 72
Want a quick shortcut? Use the **Rule of 72** to estimate how long it takes to double your money.

Just divide 72 by your annual interest rate:
• At **6%** → 72 ÷ 6 = **12 years** to double
• At **8%** → 72 ÷ 8 = **9 years** to double
• At **10%** → 72 ÷ 10 = **7.2 years** to double
• At **12%** → 72 ÷ 12 = **6 years** to double

This means at 10%, $10,000 becomes $20,000 in about 7 years, $40,000 in 14 years, and $80,000 in 21 years—without adding a single extra dollar.

#### Screen 4: Why Starting Early Matters
Compounding rewards patience. The earlier you start, the more time your money has to snowball.

Consider two people who each invest $200/month at 10% average return:
• **Person A** starts at age 20 and stops at 30 (invests for 10 years, then lets it grow).
• **Person B** starts at age 30 and invests until 60 (invests for 30 years).

By age 60, Person A—who invested for only 10 years—often ends up with MORE money than Person B, because those extra years of compounding are incredibly powerful.

Use the calculator to see how a small investment can grow into a fortune over time.

#### Quiz
1. What is compound interest?
   - A. Interest only on your initial investment
   - B. Interest on both your principal and accumulated interest [Correct]
   - C. A type of bank fee
   - D. A government tax

2. Using the Rule of 72, how long does it take to double your money at 8% interest?
   - A. 6 years
   - B. 9 years [Correct]
   - C. 12 years
   - D. 72 years

3. Why is compound interest called the 'eighth wonder of the world'?
   - A. It's very confusing
   - B. It grows your money exponentially over time [Correct]
   - C. Only banks can use it
   - D. It requires no initial investment

### Lesson 4: Wages vs Inflation: Why Idle Cash Falls Behind
Lesson ID: `lesson-1-3`
Type: interactive
XP Reward: 25
Description: Track U.S. wage growth and inflation from 2000 to present, and see why idle cash loses purchasing power.

#### Screen 1: The Big Picture
Many people feel financially squeezed even when their paycheck rises.

Why? Because what matters is not just dollars earned, but what those dollars can BUY.

If wages rise slower than inflation, your real purchasing power declines.

#### Screen 2: 2000 to Present Trend
Use the chart to compare U.S. wage growth and inflation indexed to 2000.

When the inflation line rises faster than wage growth, costs are outrunning pay.

This is one reason many households feel like they are working harder but not getting ahead.

#### Screen 3: Idle Cash Loses Value
Holding cash in a checking account is useful for bills and emergencies.

But cash that sits idle long-term usually loses purchasing power to inflation.

In other words: even if your account balance is unchanged, what it can buy keeps shrinking.

#### Screen 4: Action Rule
Practical approach:
1) Keep emergency money liquid.
2) Move excess idle cash to higher-yield savings or suitable long-term investments.
3) Focus on growing income and ownership of assets over time.

Goal: make sure your money's growth can outpace inflation.

#### Quiz
1. If inflation rises faster than wages, what usually happens to purchasing power?
   - A. It increases
   - B. It stays the same
   - C. It declines [Correct]
   - D. It doubles

2. Why can idle cash be risky over long periods?
   - A. Banks delete unused balances
   - B. Inflation can reduce what that cash can buy [Correct]
   - C. Cash automatically turns into debt
   - D. It earns guaranteed high returns

3. What is a practical strategy from this lesson?
   - A. Keep all money in a non-interest checking account forever
   - B. Ignore inflation and focus only on nominal dollars
   - C. Keep emergency cash liquid, but move excess idle cash to higher-yield or long-term growth options [Correct]
   - D. Spend quickly before prices change

### Lesson 5: Wealth = Optionality
Lesson ID: `lesson-1-4`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 25
Description: Why building wealth creates freedom, lowers stress, and supports long-term intentional living.

#### Screen 1: The Point of Wealth Is Optionality
The goal of wealth is not just luxury. It is **optionality**.

Optionality means having choices:
• Where you want to work
• When you want to take time off
• Whether you can walk away from bad environments

Money gives you negotiating power over your life.

#### Screen 2: Freedom and an Economic Safety Net
A strong financial base acts like an economic shock absorber.

With savings and assets, setbacks become manageable instead of catastrophic:
• Job loss
• Medical costs
• Family emergencies

That safety net can reduce chronic stress and decision panic.

#### Screen 3: Escaping the Hedonic Treadmill
The **hedonic treadmill** is when income rises but spending rises just as fast.

You work harder, earn more, and still feel financially stuck.

Wealth-building breaks that cycle by prioritizing:
• Ownership over consumption
• Savings rate over status spending
• Long-term freedom over short-term dopamine purchases

#### Screen 4: The Mindshift: Short-Term to Long-Term
Short-term mindset asks: 'What feels good today?'
Long-term mindset asks: 'What gives me more options in 5-10 years?'

This shift changes behavior:
• Budget decisions become values-based
• Debt decisions become strategic
• Investing becomes consistent, not emotional

#### Screen 5: Mental Health and Intentionality
Financial stability can improve mental bandwidth.

Less money stress often means:
• Better sleep
• Better focus at work and school
• Better relationships

Intentional money habits are a form of self-respect: you are designing your future instead of reacting to emergencies.

#### Screen 6: Action Prompt
Ask yourself:
1) What options do I want money to buy me in the next 3 years?
2) What one habit this month increases my optionality?
3) What spending pattern keeps me on the hedonic treadmill?

Wealth is not only about net worth. It is about owning your time.

#### Quiz
1. In this lesson, what is the core purpose of building wealth?
   - A. Buying status symbols
   - B. Optionality and life choices [Correct]
   - C. Avoiding all work forever
   - D. Keeping all money in cash

2. How does an economic safety net typically help mental health?
   - A. It increases uncertainty
   - B. It reduces stress from financial shocks [Correct]
   - C. It guarantees happiness
   - D. It removes all life problems

3. What best describes the long-term money mindset?
   - A. Spend now, figure it out later
   - B. Optimize for appearance and status
   - C. Make choices that increase options in 5-10 years [Correct]
   - D. Avoid all planning

## Module 2: Budgeting & Saving
Module ID: `module-2`
Description: Learn to control your cash flow.

### Lesson 1: The 50/30/20 Rule
Lesson ID: `lesson-2-1`
Type: interactive
XP Reward: 25
Description: A simple framework for budgeting.

#### Screen 1: The Framework
The **50/30/20 rule** is one of the most popular budgeting frameworks. It was popularized by Senator Elizabeth Warren in her book *All Your Worth*.

The idea is simple—divide your **after-tax (take-home) income** into three buckets:

• **50% → Needs**: Rent/mortgage, groceries, utilities, insurance, minimum debt payments, transportation to work.
• **30% → Wants**: Dining out, streaming services, hobbies, vacations, new clothes beyond basics.
• **20% → Savings & Debt Repayment**: Emergency fund, retirement contributions, extra debt payments beyond minimums.

This is a starting point, not a rigid law. The goal is awareness of where your money actually goes.

#### Screen 2: Applying It to Real Income
Here is what 50/30/20 looks like at different take-home pay levels:

**$3,000/month take-home:**
• Needs: $1,500 • Wants: $900 • Savings: $600

**$4,500/month take-home:**
• Needs: $2,250 • Wants: $1,350 • Savings: $900

**$6,000/month take-home:**
• Needs: $3,000 • Wants: $1,800 • Savings: $1,200

If your needs already eat more than 50%, that is a signal—not a failure. It means you should focus on either increasing income or reducing fixed costs before worrying about the other buckets.

#### Screen 3: When 50/30/20 Does Not Fit
This rule does not work perfectly for everyone. Common situations where you may need to adjust:

**High cost-of-living areas:** Rent alone may consume 40%+ of income. You might need a 60/20/20 or 70/20/10 split temporarily while you work on increasing income.

**Aggressive debt payoff:** If you are attacking high-interest debt, you might flip to 50/20/30—putting 30% toward debt repayment and limiting wants to 20%.

**High earners:** If you earn well above your needs, consider 40/20/40—saving and investing 40% to accelerate wealth building.

The framework is a guide. Adapt it to your reality.

#### Screen 4: How to Actually Track It
A budget only works if you know where your money goes. Here is how to start:

**Step 1:** Pull your last 3 months of bank and credit card statements.
**Step 2:** Categorize every transaction as a Need, Want, or Savings/Debt payment.
**Step 3:** Calculate the actual percentages. Most people are shocked by how much goes to wants.
**Step 4:** Set a target split and track monthly.

Free tools that help: your bank's spending categories, spreadsheet templates, or budgeting apps.

Use the budget allocator to practice adjusting your own income into the 50/30/20 framework.

#### Quiz
1. In the 50/30/20 rule, what percentage goes to Savings?
   - A. 50%
   - B. 30%
   - C. 20% [Correct]
   - D. 10%

2. Which category do 'Wants' fall under in the 50/30/20 rule?
   - A. 50%
   - B. 30% [Correct]
   - C. 20%
   - D. None of the above

3. Rent and utility bills are examples of:
   - A. Wants
   - B. Needs [Correct]
   - C. Investments
   - D. Debts

## Module 3: Investing 101
Module ID: `module-3`
Description: Start building wealth for the future.

### Lesson 1: What is the Stock Market?
Lesson ID: `lesson-3-1`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 20
Description: The basics of buying and selling stocks.

#### Screen 1: Ownership in Pieces
The stock market is where people buy and sell **shares** (tiny pieces of ownership) in companies.

When you buy a share of stock, you become a part-owner of that company. If the company earns more money and grows, your share becomes more valuable. If the company struggles, your share can lose value.

Stocks are traded on **exchanges**—organized marketplaces where buyers and sellers meet. The two largest in the U.S. are:
• **NYSE (New York Stock Exchange):** The oldest and largest exchange. Home to many established companies.
• **NASDAQ:** Known for technology companies. Home to names like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.

When people say 'the market is up today,' they usually mean one of the major stock indexes went up.

#### Screen 2: Key Benchmarks
A **stock index** tracks the performance of a group of stocks to represent the broader market:

• **S&P 500:** The 500 largest U.S. companies by market value. This is the most commonly cited benchmark. When people say 'the market,' they usually mean this.
• **Dow Jones Industrial Average:** 30 large, well-known U.S. companies. Older and narrower than the S&P 500.
• **NASDAQ Composite:** Heavily weighted toward technology companies.

Historically, the S&P 500 has returned about **10% per year on average** before inflation (roughly **7% after inflation**). That average includes crashes, recessions, and recoveries—it is a long-term number, not a guarantee for any single year.

#### Screen 3: How You Make Money
There are two main ways stocks can make you money:

**1. Price Appreciation (Capital Gains)**
You buy a stock at $50. It rises to $75. If you sell, your $25 profit is a capital gain.

**2. Dividends**
Some companies pay a portion of their profits directly to shareholders. This is called a **dividend**. You get paid just for owning the stock—even if you never sell it.

Not all stocks pay dividends. Growth companies (like many tech firms) reinvest profits instead of paying them out. Established companies (like utilities and consumer goods) are more likely to pay regular dividends.

Many long-term investors benefit from both: steady dividends plus price growth over time.

#### Screen 4: How to Actually Buy a Stock
To buy stocks, you need a **brokerage account**. This is like a bank account, but for investments.

**Popular brokerages for beginners:**
• Fidelity — No minimums, strong research tools, excellent customer service.
• Charles Schwab — Full-service broker, good for beginners and advanced investors.
• Vanguard — Known for low-cost index funds. Great for long-term, buy-and-hold investors.

Opening an account is free at most brokerages and takes about 15 minutes online. You link your bank account, transfer money in, and you can start investing.

Most brokerages now offer **commission-free trading** on stocks and ETFs, and allow you to buy **fractional shares**—meaning you can invest $10 in a stock that costs $500 per share.

#### Quiz
1. What do you own when you buy a stock?
   - A. A loan to the company
   - B. A small piece of the company [Correct]
   - C. The company's debt
   - D. The company's products

2. What is a dividend?
   - A. A fee for buying stocks
   - B. A portion of company profits paid to shareholders [Correct]
   - C. A type of tax
   - D. A stock's price

3. Historically, the stock market has returned about ___% per year on average.
   - A. 2%
   - B. 5%
   - C. 10% [Correct]
   - D. 50%

### Lesson 2: Timing the Market vs. Time in the Market
Lesson ID: `lesson-3-2`
Type: interactive
XP Reward: 35
Description: Can you beat the stock market?

#### Story
Character: Sarah
Sarah thinks she can predict when stocks will go up or down. She wants to trade frequently. Her friend Jen just buys and holds. Who wins?

#### Content
Many people think investing is about guessing when to buy low and sell high.
This is called 'Timing the Market', and even professionals fail at it.
The alternative is 'Time IN the Market'—buying and holding for the long term.

Myth Buster: You don't need a perfect entry. **Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)**—investing a set amount every month regardless of price—is historically more successful than trying to wait for a 'dip'.
Play the game on the right. Try to buy when the line dips and sell when it peaks. Can you beat the simple strategy of just holding?

#### Quiz
1. What does 'Time IN the Market' mean?
   - A. Trading frequently
   - B. Buying and holding for the long term [Correct]
   - C. Selling at the top
   - D. Day trading

2. What is Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)?
   - A. Investing a set amount regularly regardless of price [Correct]
   - B. Buying only when stocks are cheap
   - C. Selling at a loss
   - D. Borrowing money to invest

3. Why do most people fail at 'Timing the Market'?
   - A. They don't have enough money
   - B. Predicting short-term market moves is nearly impossible [Correct]
   - C. The market is rigged
   - D. Brokers prevent it

### Lesson 3: Index Funds: The Beginner's Best Friend
Lesson ID: `lesson-3-3`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 25
Description: Why diversification matters.

#### Screen 1: What Is an Index Fund?
An **index fund** is a single investment that holds hundreds or thousands of stocks bundled together. Instead of picking one company, you buy a tiny piece of an entire market.

The fund automatically mirrors a stock index—like the S&P 500. If the S&P 500 goes up 12% in a year, your S&P 500 index fund goes up roughly 12% too (minus a small fee).

This is called **passive investing** because no manager is trying to pick winners. The fund just holds everything in the index.

Warren Buffett—one of the greatest investors of all time—has repeatedly said that a low-cost S&P 500 index fund is the best investment most people can make.

#### Screen 2: Why Diversification Protects You
If you put all your money in one stock and that company fails, you lose everything.

If you own an index fund with 500 companies and one goes bankrupt, it barely dents your portfolio. The other 499 companies absorb the loss.

This is **diversification**—spreading your money across many investments so no single failure can wipe you out.

Real example: When Enron collapsed in 2001, employees who had their retirement savings entirely in Enron stock lost everything. Investors who held a diversified index fund barely noticed—Enron was just one small piece of the index.

#### Screen 3: Popular Index Funds to Know
You do not need to research hundreds of funds. Here are the most common starting points:

**U.S. Total Stock Market:**
• VTI (Vanguard) or ITOT (iShares) — Holds virtually every U.S. publicly traded stock.

**S&P 500:**
• VOO (Vanguard), SPY (State Street), or IVV (iShares) — The 500 largest U.S. companies.

**International Stocks:**
• VXUS (Vanguard) or IXUS (iShares) — Companies outside the U.S.

**Total World:**
• VT (Vanguard) — U.S. and international combined in one fund.

Any of these can serve as the core of a beginner portfolio.

#### Screen 4: What They Cost
Every fund charges a small annual fee called an **expense ratio**. This is a percentage of your investment taken each year to run the fund.

• A typical index fund charges **0.03% to 0.20%** per year.
• An actively managed fund might charge **0.50% to 1.50%** per year.

That difference sounds small, but it compounds. On a $100,000 portfolio over 30 years at 10% growth:
• 0.03% fee → you keep ~$1,720,000
• 1.00% fee → you keep ~$1,400,000

That is a **$320,000 difference** just from fees. This is why low-cost index funds are so powerful—you keep more of your own returns.

When choosing a fund, always check the expense ratio. Lower is almost always better for index funds.

#### Quiz

   - D. A type of bond

2. What is the main benefit of diversification?
   - A. Higher returns guaranteed
   - B. Reduced risk [Correct]
   - C. No fees
   - D. Faster trades

3. Who recommends index funds for most people?
   - A. Day traders
   - B. Warren Buffett [Correct]
   - C. Credit card companies
   - D. Real estate agents

### Lesson 4: The Opportunity Cost of Not Investing
Lesson ID: `lesson-3-4`
Type: interactive
XP Reward: 30
Description: What are you giving up by staying on the sidelines?

#### Content
**Opportunity Cost** is the value of the next best alternative you give up when you make a choice.

In investing, the biggest opportunity cost is often **doing nothing**.

If you keep $10,000 in a standard savings account earning 0.1%, you might feel 'safe'. But if the stock market returns 10%, your opportunity cost is **$990 per year**.

Over 40 years, that 'safe' choice could cost you over **$400,000** in lost growth.

**Inflation** is another hidden cost. If prices rise by 3% and your money grows by 0%, you are actually losing purchasing power. Every day your money isn't invested, it buys slightly less.

Pro tip: Don't just ask 'What if I lose money?' Ask 'What if I lose the chance to build wealth?'

#### Quiz
1. What is 'Opportunity Cost' in the context of investing?
   - A. The fee you pay to a broker
   - B. The value of the growth you give up by not investing [Correct]
   - C. The price of a single stock share
   - D. The tax on your investment gains

2. If you keep $10,000 in a savings account earning 0.1% while the market returns 10%, what is your approximate annual opportunity cost?
   - A. $10
   - B. $100
   - C. $990 [Correct]
   - D. $1,000

3. Why is inflation considered a hidden cost of not investing?

### Lesson 5: Choosing Your First Investments (After Opening Accounts)
Lesson ID: `lesson-3-5`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 35
Description: Pick investments using allocation, fund types, and strategy.

#### Screen 1: Starter Framework: Core + Explore
Once your accounts are open, use a simple structure:

• **Core (80-90%)**: diversified, long-term investments (usually passive index funds)
• **Explore (10-20%)**: specific ideas you want to research (single stocks, sector funds, etc.)

Example allocation (moderate risk):
• 50% U.S. stock index fund (passive)
• 20% International stock index fund (passive)
• 20% Bond fund (passive)
• 10% Explore bucket (active fund or individual stocks)

#### Screen 2: Active vs Passive Funds
• **Passive funds**: Track an index (like the S&P 500), usually with lower fees and broad diversification.
• **Active funds**: A manager picks investments to try to beat the market, usually with higher fees.

Teaching point:
Passive is often the default core.
Active can be a smaller satellite position.

#### Screen 3: Mutual Funds and ETFs
• **Mutual fund**: a pool of investments bought and sold at the end-of-day price.
• **ETF**: a similar basket that trades during the day like a stock.
• Both can be active or passive.

Pros of mutual funds:
• Easy diversification
• Automatic investing options

Watch for:
• Expense ratio
• Turnover
• Load fees

#### Screen 4: Public vs Private Companies
• **Public companies**: trade on stock exchanges, with easier access, more transparency, and more liquidity.
• **Private companies**: not exchange-traded; access may come through private equity, venture funds, angel investing, or crowdfunding.

Private markets are usually less liquid and higher risk.

Teaching point:
Most beginners start with public markets first.

#### Screen 5: Growth vs Dividend Investing
**Growth**
• Focus: companies reinvesting profits to expand
• Typical goal: higher long-term appreciation
• Key risk: more volatility and valuation risk

**Dividend**
• Focus: companies paying regular cash dividends
• Typical goal: income plus stability
• Key risk: slower growth and possible dividend cuts

Balanced approach:
Hold both through broad index funds, then tilt toward growth or income based on your goals.

#### Screen 6: Class Activity (15-20 Minutes)
Pick one investment idea and answer:
1) Is it active or passive?
2) Is it in a mutual fund/ETF or a single company?
3) Is it public or private?
4) Is it more growth or dividend?
5) What allocation % would you give it, and why?

#### Screen 7: Quick Rules for Beginners
• Keep most money in diversified core funds.
• Limit single-stock bets to a small percentage.
• Review fees before buying.
• Rebalance once or twice per year.
• Invest based on goals and timeline, not hype.

#### Quiz
1. In the 'Core + Explore' framework, what is the typical core allocation range?
   - A. 20-30%
   - B. 40-50%
   - C. 60-70%
   - D. 80-90% [Correct]

2. Which statement best describes a passive fund?
   - A. A manager actively trades to beat the market
   - B. It tracks an index and usually has lower fees [Correct]
   - C. It only invests in private companies
   - D. It guarantees market outperformance

3. For most beginners, which market is usually the better starting point?
   - A. Private markets
   - B. Public markets [Correct]
   - C. Angel investing only
   - D. Venture capital only

### Lesson 6: Money Multiplier: Start Early vs Start Late
Lesson ID: `lesson-3-6`
Type: interactive
XP Reward: 40
Description: Compare early investing, late catch-up, lump sums, and automatic recurring contributions.

#### Screen 1: The Multiplier Effect
The biggest investing edge is often **time**, not perfect stock picks.

Money invested young has more years to compound.

That means a small automatic amount started early can beat much larger contributions started later.

#### Screen 2: Recurring and Automatic Investing
Use recurring, automatic contributions to remove emotion and procrastination.

Even if you start with a small monthly amount, consistency can create a large long-term result.

Your future self benefits from habits you can sustain, not just occasional big deposits.

#### Screen 3: Early Lump Sum vs Late Lump Sum
A lump sum invested early usually has a major advantage over the same lump sum invested later.

The chart compares:
• Early lump sum growth
• Late lump sum with the same amount
• How much larger the late lump sum must be just to catch up

#### Screen 4: Catch-Up Cost
Waiting often forces painful catch-up math:
• Much higher monthly contributions
• Larger total dollars invested
• More pressure on future cash flow

The goal is simple: start early, automate, and stay consistent.

#### Quiz
1. What is usually the biggest advantage in long-term investing?
   - A. Perfect market timing
   - B. Starting early and giving compounding more time [Correct]
   - C. Switching strategies every month
   - D. Only investing when markets are at all-time highs

2. Why is automatic recurring investing useful?
   - A. It guarantees returns
   - B. It removes emotion and builds consistency [Correct]
   - C. It eliminates risk completely
   - D. It works only for large incomes

3. If you start later, what is often required to hit the same goal?
   - A. Lower monthly contributions
   - B. Less total money invested
   - C. Higher catch-up contributions or a larger lump sum [Correct]
   - D. No behavior change at all

## Module 4: Roth IRA Mastery
Module ID: `module-roth-ira`
Description: Build tax-free long-term wealth with a Roth IRA.

### Lesson 1: Roth IRA Fundamentals
Lesson ID: `lesson-roth-1`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 30
Description: How a Roth IRA works and why it is powerful.

#### Screen 1: What Is a Roth IRA?
A **Roth IRA** is an individual retirement account funded with after-tax dollars.

You do **not** get a tax deduction today, but qualified withdrawals in retirement are generally **tax-free**.

This creates a simple long-term bet: pay taxes now, avoid taxes later.

For younger earners or anyone expecting higher future income, that tradeoff can be extremely valuable.

#### Screen 2: Why Investors Love Roth Accounts
Roth IRAs have several advantages:
• Tax-free growth over decades
• No required minimum distributions (RMDs) during the original owner's lifetime
• Broad investment flexibility (index funds, ETFs, bonds, etc.)

Because there are no lifetime RMDs, Roth assets are useful for both retirement spending and estate planning.

#### Screen 3: Roth IRA vs Traditional IRA
**Traditional IRA**: tax break now, taxes later.
**Roth IRA**: taxes now, tax-free later.

There is no universal winner. The best choice depends on your current tax bracket vs expected future bracket.

If future tax rates or your future income are likely higher, Roth often becomes more attractive.

#### Quiz
1. What is the core tax structure of a Roth IRA?
   - A. Tax deduction now, taxed withdrawals later
   - B. After-tax contributions, tax-free qualified withdrawals later [Correct]
   - C. Pre-tax contributions only, penalty-free anytime
   - D. No taxes ever under any condition

2. Which statement is true about required minimum distributions (RMDs) for original Roth IRA owners?
   - A. RMDs begin at age 59.5
   - B. RMDs begin at age 65
   - C. No lifetime RMDs for the original owner [Correct]
   - D. RMDs are required every year after first contribution

3. Roth IRAs are often most attractive when:
   - A. You expect lower future tax rates and lower future income
   - B. You expect higher future tax rates or higher future income [Correct]
   - C. You never plan to retire
   - D. You only invest in cash

### Lesson 2: Contribution Rules, Limits, and Eligibility
Lesson ID: `lesson-roth-2`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 30
Description: Avoid common Roth IRA mistakes.

#### Screen 1: Contribution Basics
Roth IRA contributions are limited each year by IRS rules.

Core rules:
• You must have eligible earned income.
• Annual contribution caps apply.
• Income-based phaseouts can reduce or eliminate direct Roth eligibility.

Always verify current-year IRS limits before contributing.

#### Screen 2: Income Phaseouts and Backdoor Roth
If your income is above direct Roth IRA limits, you may still use a **Backdoor Roth** strategy:
1) Contribute to a Traditional IRA (non-deductible if needed).
2) Convert that amount to Roth IRA.

Important: The **pro-rata rule** can create taxes if you hold other pre-tax IRA balances.

This is where many high-income earners make errors. Track basis carefully and use tax forms correctly.

#### Screen 3: Operational Checklist
Use this yearly checklist:
• Confirm eligibility and current-year limits
• Fund account early (more time in market)
• Automate monthly contributions
• Keep records for contributions and conversions

Small, consistent contributions over many years usually beat sporadic large contributions.

#### Quiz
1. What can reduce or eliminate direct Roth IRA contribution eligibility?
   - A. Owning ETFs
   - B. Income-based phaseout limits [Correct]
   - C. Having a checking account
   - D. Being under age 40

2. What is a common two-step Backdoor Roth approach?
   - A. Contribute directly to Roth, then move to 401k
   - B. Contribute to Traditional IRA, then convert to Roth IRA [Correct]
   - C. Sell stocks, then buy CDs
   - D. Open an HSA, then convert it to Roth

3. Why must high-income investors watch the pro-rata rule?
   - A. It controls stock market returns
   - B. It can create unexpected taxes when converting if other pre-tax IRA balances exist [Correct]
   - C. It eliminates contribution limits
   - D. It guarantees tax-free conversions

### Lesson 3: How to Invest Inside a Roth IRA
Lesson ID: `lesson-roth-3`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 30
Description: Asset allocation and long-term execution.

#### Screen 1: The Account Is a Container
A Roth IRA is the account type, not the investment itself.

You still need an investment plan inside it.

Common beginner-friendly structure:
• Broad U.S. stock index fund
• International index fund
• Bond allocation based on risk tolerance and timeline

#### Screen 2: Tax-Efficient Placement Strategy
Because Roth growth can become tax-free, many investors place higher-growth assets in Roth accounts over long periods.

That does NOT mean taking reckless risk.
It means aligning risk level with your horizon and maintaining diversification.

Core principles:
• Keep costs low
• Rebalance periodically
• Stay invested through volatility

#### Screen 3: Behavioral Discipline
Most Roth IRA success comes from behavior, not prediction:
• Invest consistently
• Avoid panic-selling during downturns
• Increase contributions when income rises

The biggest edge is often simply contributing every year and not interrupting compounding.

#### Quiz
1. A Roth IRA is best described as:
   - A. A stock market prediction tool
   - B. An account wrapper that holds investments [Correct]
   - C. A guaranteed bond product
   - D. A type of checking account

2. Which is generally a sound long-term Roth IRA approach?
   - A. Concentrate in one stock
   - B. Use diversified low-cost funds and rebalance periodically [Correct]
   - C. Only hold cash forever
   - D. Trade options weekly

3. What behavior most improves Roth outcomes over decades?
   - A. Trying to time every market move
   - B. Contributing consistently and staying invested [Correct]
   - C. Withdrawing at every downturn
   - D. Changing strategy every month

### Lesson 4: Withdrawals, Conversions, and Real-Life Use
Lesson ID: `lesson-roth-4`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 35
Description: Use Roth rules correctly to avoid penalties.

#### Screen 1: Withdrawal Ordering Rules
Roth IRA withdrawals generally follow this order:
1) Contributions
2) Conversions
3) Earnings

Because contributions come out first, many people view Roth contributions as more flexible than pre-tax retirement assets.

Earnings typically require meeting qualified distribution rules to avoid taxes/penalties.

#### Screen 2: Five-Year and Age Rules
Qualified Roth distributions generally depend on timing and age conditions.

That is why planning matters:
• Keep records for contribution and conversion years
• Understand how the 5-year clock applies
• Coordinate withdrawals with other accounts

When used correctly, Roth can provide tax-free cash flow in retirement and reduce future tax uncertainty.

#### Screen 3: Roth Decision Framework
Before taking action, ask:
• Am I eligible for direct Roth contributions this year?
• If not, does Backdoor Roth make sense given my IRA balances?
• Is my asset mix appropriate for my horizon and risk profile?

Your Roth IRA should be part of a full plan:
401k match -> HSA (if eligible) -> Roth IRA -> additional tax-advantaged space.

#### Quiz
1. Roth IRA withdrawal ordering generally starts with:
   - A. Earnings
   - B. Contributions [Correct]
   - C. Employer match
   - D. Bond interest

2. Why is good record-keeping important for Roth contributions and conversions?
   - A. To predict interest rates
   - B. To avoid confusion about tax/penalty treatment [Correct]
   - C. To increase contribution limits
   - D. To skip tax filing entirely

3. Which sequence is commonly recommended for many savers?
   - A. Roth IRA first, ignore employer match
   - B. 401k match -> HSA (if eligible) -> Roth IRA [Correct]
   - C. Credit card debt first, then nothing else
   - D. Treasury bills only

## Module 5: 401(k) Master Plan
Module ID: `module-401k`
Description: Use tax-advantaged retirement accounts and capture every dollar of employer match.

### Lesson 1: 401(k) Fundamentals
Lesson ID: `lesson-401k-1`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 25
Description: How 401(k)s work, why they matter, and where they fit in your plan.

#### Screen 1: What a 401(k) Actually Is
A **401(k)** is an employer-sponsored retirement account.

You contribute directly from your paycheck, and the money can be invested for long-term growth.

The two biggest advantages are:
• Tax benefits
• Potential employer matching contributions

For most workers, this is the first place to start investing for retirement.

#### Screen 2: Traditional vs Roth 401(k)
**Traditional 401(k):** contributions reduce taxable income now; withdrawals are taxed later.
**Roth 401(k):** contributions are after-tax now; qualified withdrawals are tax-free later.

Many plans allow both options.

General rule: choose based on whether your tax rate is likely higher now or in retirement.

#### Screen 3: Why Starting Early Changes Everything
A 401(k) combines payroll automation + compounding.

That means you build wealth before money hits your checking account.

Small early contributions often beat large delayed contributions because time is the biggest multiplier.

#### Quiz
1. What is a 401(k)?
   - A. A personal checking account
   - B. An employer-sponsored retirement account [Correct]
   - C. A government bond
   - D. A credit score model

2. Which statement best describes a Traditional 401(k)?
   - A. After-tax contributions and tax-free qualified withdrawals
   - B. Pre-tax contributions with taxes paid at withdrawal [Correct]
   - C. No taxes at contribution or withdrawal
   - D. Only employer contributes

3. Why does starting contributions earlier usually help?
   - A. It lowers your salary
   - B. It gives compounding more time [Correct]
   - C. It avoids all investment risk
   - D. It removes all taxes forever

### Lesson 2: Employer Match: The Highest-Return Move
Lesson ID: `lesson-401k-2`
Type: interactive
XP Reward: 35
Description: Visualize how much wealth you lose when you miss your employer match.

#### Screen 1: Match Formula in Plain English
Typical offer: **50% match up to 6% of salary**.

If you contribute 6%, your employer adds 3%.

That is an immediate return before any market growth.

Contributing below the match cap is usually equivalent to refusing part of your compensation.

#### Screen 2: Use the Simulator
Adjust salary, contribution rate, employer match, and years.

Compare:
• Employee contributions only
• Employee + employer match

Focus on the long-term gap. The match compounds for decades.

#### Screen 3: Action Rule
At minimum, contribute enough to earn the **full employer match**.

Then increase your savings rate 1% each year or whenever you get a raise.

This approach improves retirement outcomes without requiring perfect market timing.

#### Quiz
1. If a company matches 50% up to 6% of salary, contributing 6% usually gets you:
   - A. An extra 6% from employer
   - B. An extra 3% from employer [Correct]
   - C. No employer contribution
   - D. A one-time bonus only

2. Contributing below your plan's match cap usually means:
   - A. Higher tax deductions
   - B. You are leaving compensation on the table [Correct]
   - C. You are guaranteed higher returns
   - D. Your account gets locked

3. What does the simulator primarily show?
   - A. How to day-trade inside a 401(k)
   - B. The long-term wealth gap with vs. without employer match [Correct]
   - C. Your exact future Social Security check
   - D. How to avoid all market losses

### Lesson 3: Contribution Strategy and Limits
Lesson ID: `lesson-401k-3`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 25
Description: Build a practical system you can run every year.

#### Screen 1: Core Priority Stack
A common order for many workers:
1) 401(k) to full match
2) HSA (if eligible)
3) IRA (Roth or Traditional)
4) Increase 401(k) toward annual limit

This sequence balances tax savings, flexibility, and employer benefits.

#### Screen 2: Rate Targets
If possible, aim for **10-15% total retirement savings** (your money + match), then progress toward 15-20% over time.

Automate increases so your savings rate rises with income.

Even a 1% annual increase can produce major long-term gains.

#### Screen 3: Avoid Common Errors
Frequent mistakes:
• Contributing below full match
• Remaining 100% in stable value/cash for decades
• Ignoring fees in fund choices
• Stopping contributions after market downturns

Treat your 401(k) as a long game, not a short-term account.

#### Quiz
1. What is a common first priority in retirement saving?
   - A. Max taxable brokerage first
   - B. Contribute enough to get full 401(k) match [Correct]
   - C. Hold all money in cash forever
   - D. Wait until age 50 to begin

2. A practical long-term target for many workers is roughly:
   - A. 1-2% retirement savings
   - B. 10-15% total retirement savings, then higher over time [Correct]
   - C. 100% of income to retirement
   - D. Only save in years markets go up

3. Which is a common 401(k) mistake?
   - A. Using low-cost diversified funds
   - B. Ignoring fees and staying below full match [Correct]
   - C. Increasing contributions with raises
   - D. Staying consistent during volatility

### Lesson 4: How to Invest Inside Your 401(k)
Lesson ID: `lesson-401k-4`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 25
Description: Choose funds with a simple, durable allocation.

#### Screen 1: Pick a Default You Can Stick With
Good options for many beginners:
• A low-cost target-date fund
• Or a diversified mix of U.S. stocks, international stocks, and bonds

Perfection is not required. Consistency and cost control matter more.

#### Screen 2: Fee Awareness
Expense ratios directly reduce your returns.

A fund charging 0.80% can materially underperform a similar 0.05% index fund over decades.

When choices are similar, lower-cost funds are usually better.

#### Screen 3: Rebalancing Discipline
Over time, market moves can drift your allocation away from target risk.

Rebalance periodically (or use target-date funds that auto-rebalance).

Goal: keep risk appropriate without making emotional decisions.

#### Quiz
1. A target-date fund is often used because it:
   - A. Guarantees returns
   - B. Automatically adjusts allocation over time [Correct]
   - C. Avoids all stock exposure
   - D. Has no fees ever

2. Why do expense ratios matter?
   - A. They are unrelated to returns
   - B. Higher fees can significantly reduce long-term growth [Correct]
   - C. They only affect bonds
   - D. They only matter for day traders

3. What is rebalancing?
   - A. Borrowing against your 401(k)
   - B. Bringing portfolio weights back to target allocation [Correct]
   - C. Selling everything during downturns
   - D. Switching to cash every month

### Lesson 5: Vesting, Job Changes, and Withdrawals
Lesson ID: `lesson-401k-5`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 30
Description: Protect your retirement money when life changes.

#### Screen 1: Vesting Basics
Your contributions are always yours.

Employer contributions may follow a **vesting schedule**.

If you leave early, you might forfeit part of the employer match. Read your plan document before switching jobs.

#### Screen 2: When You Change Jobs
Common options:
• Leave money in old 401(k) (if allowed)
• Roll into new employer 401(k)
• Roll to an IRA

Avoid cashing out unless absolutely necessary. Taxes and penalties can erase years of progress.

#### Screen 3: Loans and Early Withdrawals
401(k) loans and early withdrawals should be last-resort tools.

They can trigger taxes, penalties, and long-term opportunity cost from lost compounding.

Build an emergency fund so retirement savings stay invested.

#### Quiz
1. Which money in a 401(k) is always yours immediately?
   - A. Only employer match
   - B. Your own contributions [Correct]
   - C. None until age 59.5
   - D. Only profits from bonds

2. What does vesting usually apply to?
   - A. Your own payroll contributions
   - B. Employer contributions [Correct]
   - C. Tax forms
   - D. Stock market indexes

3. When changing jobs, what is generally safer than cashing out?
   - A. Withdrawing everything for spending
   - B. Rolling funds into a new 401(k) or IRA [Correct]
   - C. Closing all retirement accounts
   - D. Moving all assets to checking

## Module 6: Big Purchases: Cars
Module ID: `module-4`
Description: Make smart decisions on your biggest expenses.

### Lesson 1: Buy vs. Lease vs. Cash: The Great Debate
Lesson ID: `lesson-4-1`
Type: interactive
XP Reward: 35
Description: Understand the true cost of car ownership.

#### Story
Character: Alex
Alex just got their first job and needs a car. They have $10,000 saved. A new car costs $30,000. What should Alex do?

#### Content
OPTION 1: PAY CASH
Pros: No monthly payments, no interest, you own the car outright.
Cons: Ties up a lot of money that could be invested instead.

OPTION 2: FINANCE (Loan)

Cons: Never own the car, mileage limits, fees for wear and tear.

Use the calculator to compare the TRUE COST of each option over 5 years.

#### Quiz
1. What is a major disadvantage of leasing a car?
   - A. No monthly payments
   - B. You never own the car [Correct]

   - C. You paid cash
   - D. The loan has low interest

3. Which option avoids paying interest on a car?
   - A. Financing
   - B. Leasing
   - C. Paying cash [Correct]
   - D. Credit card

### Lesson 2: Opportunity Cost: The Hidden Factor
Lesson ID: `lesson-4-2`
Type: interactive
XP Reward: 30
Description: What else could your money be doing?

#### Screen 1: Cars Depreciate. Investments Appreciate.
Here is the core problem with spending big on a car: cars lose value while investments gain value. That gap is your **opportunity cost**.

A new car loses roughly **20% of its value in the first year** and about **60% over five years**.

That means a $30,000 new car is worth roughly $12,000 after 5 years. You lost $18,000 in value just by owning it.

Meanwhile, $30,000 invested at a 10% average return would grow to roughly $48,000 over the same 5 years.

The total gap: your $30,000 turned into $12,000 (car) instead of $48,000 (investment). That is a **$36,000 swing** in just five years.

#### Screen 2: The Used Car Advantage
Because depreciation is steepest in the first 2-3 years, buying a **2-3 year old used car** lets someone else absorb the biggest loss.

Example: A car with an MSRP of $35,000 might sell for $22,000 at 3 years old with 30,000 miles. Same car, most of its useful life ahead of it, $13,000 cheaper.

If you invest that $13,000 difference instead of spending it:
• After 10 years at 10%: ~$33,700
• After 20 years at 10%: ~$87,500
• After 30 years at 10%: ~$226,800

One car purchase decision, made wisely, can be worth a quarter-million dollars over your lifetime.

#### Screen 3: The Real Cost per Year
A better way to compare vehicles is **total cost per year of ownership**—not sticker price or monthly payment.

Total cost includes:
• Purchase price minus resale value (depreciation)
• Interest paid on any loan
• Insurance premiums
• Fuel and maintenance
• Opportunity cost of money tied up in the car

A $15,000 used car you drive for 8 years may cost $3,000/year total. A $40,000 new car you trade in after 4 years may cost $12,000/year total. The 'cheap' monthly payment on the new car hides the real math.

Use the calculator to compare what your car money could be doing if it were invested instead.

#### Quiz
1. What is opportunity cost?
   - A. The price of a product
   - B. What you give up by choosing one option over another [Correct]
   - C. A hidden fee
   - D. The cost of shipping

2. If you invest $30,000 at 10% for 5 years, it becomes approximately:
   - A. $33,000
   - B. $40,000
   - C. $48,000 [Correct]
   - D. $60,000

3. Before making a big purchase, you should ask:
   - A. What's the best use of this money? [Correct]
   - B. What's the trendiest option?
   - C. What will impress my friends?
   - D. What color is best?

### Lesson 3: The "Lower Monthly Payment" Sales Tactic
Lesson ID: `lesson-4-3`
Type: interactive
XP Reward: 35
Description: How longer loan terms can quietly cost you thousands.

#### Screen 1: The Pitch You Will Hear
In dealerships and loan offices, one tactic is very common:

"Don't worry about total cost, we can get your payment down to what you want."

They often lower the monthly payment by stretching the loan from 48 or 60 months out to 72 or 84 months.

Lower payment does NOT automatically mean a better deal.

#### Screen 2: Why It Works on Buyers
Most people shop by monthly payment because it feels affordable.

But payment-focused shopping hides:
• More months of interest
• Higher total amount paid
• Slower equity build
• Greater chance of being underwater

You can feel short-term relief while creating long-term cost.

#### Screen 3: The Real Comparison
Always compare offers using all three numbers:
1) Monthly payment
2) Total interest paid
3) Total paid over full term

Use the simulator to compare the same loan amount at 48, 60, 72, and 84 months.

Then decide if the monthly savings are worth the extra interest.

#### Screen 4: Protect Yourself
Before signing, ask the seller/lender:
• Show me the out-the-door price
• Show me total interest by term length
• Show me any add-ons rolled into the loan

Rule: Choose the shortest term that fits your budget comfortably.
If the payment is still too high, lower the purchase price instead of extending the term.

#### Quiz
1. What is the common sales tactic in auto financing discussed in this lesson?
   - A. Raise your down payment after signing
   - B. Lower monthly payment by extending loan term [Correct]
   - C. Remove all interest charges
   - D. Offer unlimited free maintenance

2. When comparing loan offers, which metric is most often hidden when people focus only on monthly payment?
   - A. Vehicle color options
   - B. Dealer business hours
   - C. Total interest and total paid [Correct]
   - D. Registration state

3. If the payment is still too high, what is usually better than stretching to a much longer term?
   - A. Increase the purchase price

Type: reading
XP Reward: 30
Description: What does your policy actually cover?

#### Content
**Homeowner's Insurance** protects your property and belongings from damage, theft, and liability claims.

**DWELLING COVERAGE**: Pays to rebuild or repair your home's structure if damaged by covered events (fire, storms, vandalism).
**PERSONAL PROPERTY**: Covers your belongings—furniture, electronics, clothes—if stolen or destroyed.
**LIABILITY PROTECTION**: Covers legal bills if someone is injured on your property and sues you.

**What's NOT covered?** Floods and earthquakes require separate policies. Standard policies also exclude 'maintenance issues' like mold or pest damage.

Pro tip: Create a **home inventory** (photos/video of your belongings). If disaster strikes, you'll have proof for your claim.

#### Quiz
1. What does 'Dwelling Coverage' in a homeowner's policy protect?
   - A. Your car

### Lesson 4: Life Insurance: Planning for the Unexpected
Lesson ID: `lesson-5-4`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 35
Description: Protect your loved ones financially.

#### Content
**Life Insurance** pays a lump sum to your beneficiaries (usually family) if you pass away.

**TERM LIFE**: Coverage for a set period (e.g., 20 years). Cheapest option. If you outlive the term, the policy expires worthless.
**WHOLE LIFE**: Permanent coverage that also builds 'cash value' over time. Much more expensive than term.

**Who needs it?** Anyone with dependents (spouse, children) who rely on your income. If you're single with no dependents, you likely don't need it yet.

**Rule of Thumb**: Get coverage worth 10-12x your annual income. A $60k earner should aim for $600k-$720k in coverage.

Pro tip: Buy term insurance when you're young and healthy—premiums are locked in and stay low.

#### Quiz
1. What is the main difference between Term Life and Whole Life insurance?
   - A. Term is permanent, Whole expires
   - B. Term expires after a set period, Whole is permanent [Correct]
   - C. They are the same
   - D. Whole Life is cheaper

2. Who needs life insurance the most?
   - A. Single people with no dependents
   - B. People with dependents relying on their income [Correct]
   - C. Retirees with no debt
   - D. Children

3. A common rule of thumb is that life insurance coverage should be how many times your annual income?
   - A. 1-2x
   - B. 5x
   - C. 10-12x [Correct]
   - D. 50x

## Module 8: Credit & Debt
Module ID: `module-6`
Description: Master the tools that can build or destroy wealth.

### Lesson 1: Credit Scores: Your Financial Report Card
Lesson ID: `lesson-6-1`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 30
Description: How they work and why they matter.

#### Content
Your credit score is a number from 300-850 that tells lenders how risky you are.
750+ = Excellent. 700-749 = Good. 650-699 = Fair. Below 650 = Poor.

Pro tip: Avoid 'Hard Pulls' (checking for new loans) too often, as they can temporarily drop your score. 'Soft Pulls' (checking your own score) do NOT hurt it.

WHAT AFFECTS YOUR SCORE:
• Payment History (35%): Pay bills on time!
• Credit Utilization (30%): Use less than 30% of your credit limit (ideally under 10% for the best score).
• Length of History (15%): Older accounts help.
• Credit Mix (10%): Having different types of credit helps.
• New Credit (10%): Don't open too many accounts at once.

#### Quiz
1. What is considered an 'Excellent' credit score?
   - A. 500+
   - B. 650+
   - C. 750+ [Correct]

2. Which factor has the biggest impact on your credit score?
   - A. Credit mix
   - B. New credit
   - C. Payment history [Correct]
   - D. Length of history

3. A 'soft pull' on your credit:
   - A. Hurts your score a lot
   - B. Slightly lowers your score
   - C. Does NOT hurt your score [Correct]
   - D. Is illegal

### Lesson 3: The Trap of Buy Now, Pay Later
Lesson ID: `lesson-6-3`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 30
Description: Why splitting payments is dangerous.

#### Content
**Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)** services let you split a purchase into 4 small payments.
It feels like you're spending less money, but you aren't.
The Danger: It encourages you to buy things you can't actually afford today.
It decouples the 'pain of paying' from the 'pleasure of buying'.
If you miss a payment, the fees can be massive. Treat BNPL like credit card debt.

#### Quiz
1. What does BNPL stand for?
   - A. Buy Now, Pay Less
   - B. Buy Now, Pay Later [Correct]
   - C. Borrow Now, Pay Loans
   - D. Best New Payment Loans

2. What is a danger of BNPL services?
   - A. They save too much money
   - B. They encourage buying things you can't afford [Correct]
   - C. They improve your credit score
   - D. They have no fees

3. How should you treat BNPL?
   - A. As free money
   - B. As a savings account
   - C. Like credit card debt [Correct]
   - D. As an investment

---

### Lesson 4: Credit Cards + BNPL: The Double-Debt Trap
Lesson ID: `lesson-6-4`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 35
Description: How minimum payments and split plans can quietly snowball.

#### Screen 1: The Minimum Payment Illusion
Credit card issuers show a low **minimum payment** to keep your account current.

But minimum payments mostly cover interest at high APRs.

That means your balance can shrink very slowly while interest keeps compounding month after month.

A payment that feels manageable can keep you in debt for years.

#### Screen 2: How BNPL Stacks on Top
BNPL feels separate from credit cards, but it often piles on top of existing debt.

Example pattern:
• 4-pay shoes
• 4-pay headphones
• 4-pay travel booking

Each payment looks small alone, but together they can crush cash flow and trigger missed due dates.

#### Screen 3: Why This Becomes a Trap
When cash gets tight, people often:
• Put essentials on a credit card
• Use new BNPL plans to avoid paying full price now
• Pay only minimums on everything

That cycle can turn short-term spending into long-term high-interest debt.

#### Screen 4: Escape Plan
Use this playbook:
1) List every card and BNPL plan with balance, APR/fees, and due date.
2) Stop new BNPL purchases until all existing plans are cleared.
3) Pay at least minimums on everything, then send extra to the highest APR balance.
4) Turn on autopay + payment reminders to avoid late fees.
5) If needed, call issuers and request hardship plans or APR reductions.

#### Quiz
1. Why is paying only the minimum on a high-APR credit card risky?
   - A. It always hurts your credit score immediately
   - B. Most of the payment can go to interest, slowing balance payoff [Correct]
   - C. It cancels your card rewards automatically
   - D. It removes all late fees

2. What is a key risk of using multiple BNPL plans at once?
   - A. Your paycheck always increases
   - B. Small payments can stack and strain monthly cash flow [Correct]
   - C. Interest rates become fixed forever
   - D. Your rent is automatically reduced

3. What is a strong first step to escape the credit card + BNPL trap?
   - A. Open more cards for flexibility
   - B. Stop tracking due dates
   - C. List all balances/APRs/due dates and stop new BNPL purchases [Correct]
   - D. Pay only whichever bill has the smallest minimum

## Module 9: Investing 201: The Deep End
Module ID: `module-7`
Description: Advanced concepts: ETFs, Meme Stocks, and Options.

### Lesson 1: ETFs vs. Mutual Funds
Lesson ID: `lesson-7-1`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 40
Description: Understanding modern investment vehicles.

#### Screen 1: Two Wrappers, Same Idea
Both **ETFs** and **Mutual Funds** are baskets that hold many investments inside a single product. The difference is how they are bought, sold, and priced.

**ETF (Exchange Traded Fund):**
• Trades on a stock exchange throughout the day, just like a stock.
• You can buy or sell at any time the market is open.
• Price changes in real time as the market moves.
• You can buy as little as 1 share (or fractional shares at many brokerages).

**Mutual Fund:**
• Does NOT trade during the day. All buy/sell orders execute once, at the closing price.
• Often has minimum investment requirements ($1,000-$3,000 to start at some firms).
• Price is calculated once per day after markets close (called the NAV—Net Asset Value).

#### Screen 2: Fees and Tax Efficiency
**Expense Ratios:**
ETFs tend to have lower expense ratios. Popular index ETFs charge as low as 0.03%. Mutual fund versions of the same index may charge 0.10-0.50% or more.

**Tax Efficiency:**
ETFs are generally more tax-efficient in taxable accounts. Their structure allows investors to buy and sell without triggering taxable events for other holders. Mutual funds can distribute capital gains to all shareholders—even if you did not sell anything—creating a surprise tax bill at year end.

**Trading Costs:**
Most brokerages charge $0 commission on ETFs. Mutual funds are also commission-free at many firms, but some charge transaction fees for funds outside their own family.

In tax-advantaged accounts (401k, IRA), the tax difference matters less—so mutual funds work just fine.

#### Screen 3: When Each One Wins
**ETFs are usually better when:**
• You want to start with a small amount (no minimums).
• You are investing in a taxable brokerage account.
• You want real-time pricing and flexibility.
• You want the lowest possible expense ratio.

**Mutual funds are usually better when:**
• Your 401(k) only offers mutual fund options (this is common).
• You want automatic recurring investments on a set schedule (many mutual funds handle this seamlessly).
• You prefer to invest exact dollar amounts ($200/month) rather than buying whole shares.

For most beginners starting in a personal brokerage account, **ETFs are the easiest and cheapest entry point** to build a diversified portfolio.

#### Quiz
1. How does an ETF trade differently from a Mutual Fund?
   - A. ETFs trade once per day
   - B. ETFs trade like stocks throughout the day [Correct]
   - C. ETFs can't be bought by individuals
   - D. ETFs have higher fees

2. Which investment vehicle typically has lower fees?
   - A. Mutual Funds
   - B. ETFs [Correct]
   - C. Savings accounts
   - D. Hedge funds

3. For most beginners, what is the easiest way to build a diversified portfolio?
   - A. Individual stocks
   - B. Options trading
   - C. ETFs [Correct]
   - D. Cryptocurrency

### Lesson 2: Meme Stocks & Volatility
Lesson ID: `lesson-7-2`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 40
Description: When investing becomes gambling.

#### Story
Character: Kevin
Kevin sees a GameStore stock soaring 500% in a week. Everyone on the internet is buying it. He puts his tuition money in, hoping to double it.

#### Screen 1: What Makes a Stock a Meme Stock
**Meme Stocks** are companies whose stock price is driven primarily by social media hype, viral momentum, and crowd psychology—not by the company's actual business performance.

Classic pattern:
1. A stock gets popular on social media (Reddit, Twitter/X, TikTok, Discord).
2. Viral posts create FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). People pile in.
3. Price spikes 100-1000% in days or weeks.
4. Early buyers sell for huge profits. Late buyers are left holding the loss.
5. Price crashes back down. The hype moves to the next stock.

The company itself may not have changed at all. No new product, no new revenue, no new plan. The only thing that changed was the story people told each other online.

#### Screen 2: FOMO and the Psychology Trap
The reason meme stocks are so dangerous is that they exploit powerful psychological biases:

• **FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out):** Seeing others post gains makes you feel like you are losing by not participating.
• **Survivorship Bias:** You see the screenshots of people who made $50,000—but not the thousands who lost quietly.
• **Herd Mentality:** If everyone is buying, it must be safe—right? No. Crowds can be spectacularly wrong.
• **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** After the price drops, people hold on hoping to break even instead of cutting losses.

Social media amplifies all of these. Gains are celebrated publicly. Losses are hidden. This creates a distorted picture of reality.

#### Screen 3: Volatility: The Measure of Risk
**Volatility** means how wildly and unpredictably a price swings. Meme stocks have extreme volatility.

A typical S&P 500 index fund might move 1-2% in a day. A meme stock can move **20-50% in a single day**—in either direction.

That means you could invest $1,000 Monday morning and have $500 by Friday. Or $2,000. You have no reliable way to predict which.

This is why meme stock trading is closer to **gambling** than investing. In gambling, the house has an edge. With meme stocks, the early insiders and large players have the edge.

#### Screen 4: How to Protect Yourself
Meme stocks are not inherently evil—but you need rules if you engage with them:

• **Never invest money you cannot afford to lose.** Tuition money, rent money, and emergency funds are off limits.
• **Set a hard cap.** Some investors allocate 5% or less of their portfolio to speculative bets. The other 95% stays in diversified index funds.
• **Decide your exit before you enter.** Set a price where you will sell—both on the upside and downside—before you buy.
• **Turn off the noise.** Unfollow hype accounts. The people hyping a stock online may be selling while telling you to buy.

The vast majority of your wealth should be built through boring, consistent, diversified investing. Meme stocks are entertainment—not a financial plan.

#### Quiz
1. What drives the price of 'Meme Stocks'?
   - A. Company profits
   - B. Social media hype [Correct]
   - C. Dividends
   - D. Government regulation

2. What is volatility?
   - A. Steady, predictable growth
   - B. Wild price swings [Correct]
   - C. A type of bond
   - D. A trading fee

3. Investing in meme stocks is most similar to:
   - A. Long-term investing
   - B. Gambling [Correct]
   - C. Saving in a bank
   - D. Buying bonds

### Lesson 3: Intro to Options: High Risk, High Reward
Lesson ID: `lesson-7-3`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 50
Description: The casino of the stock market.

#### Screen 1: What Is an Option?
An **option** is a contract that gives you the right—but not the obligation—to buy or sell a stock at a specific price before a specific date.

There are two types:
• **Call Option:** A bet that the stock price will go UP. It gives you the right to BUY the stock at a set price.
• **Put Option:** A bet that the stock price will go DOWN. It gives you the right to SELL the stock at a set price.

Every option contract has three key terms:
• **Strike Price:** The price at which you can buy/sell the stock.
• **Expiration Date:** The deadline by which the stock must move in your favor.
• **Premium:** The price you pay to purchase the option contract.

#### Screen 2: How Leverage Multiplies Gains and Losses
Options use **leverage**—a small amount of money controls a much larger position.

Each option contract typically controls **100 shares** of the underlying stock.

**Example:**
A stock trades at $100. You buy a call option with a $105 strike price for a $3 premium. Your total cost: $300 (100 shares × $3).

• If the stock rises to $115, your option is worth $10 per share ($1,000 total). You paid $300, so your profit is **$700—a 233% return**.
• If the stock stays below $105 by expiration, your option expires worthless. You lose the entire **$300—a 100% loss**.

The same stock move that earns a shareholder 15% could earn an options trader 233%—or lose them everything. That is leverage.

#### Screen 3: Why Most Retail Traders Lose
Studies consistently show that the majority of retail options traders lose money. Here is why:

• **Time Decay:** Options lose value every single day as expiration approaches. You are not just betting on direction—you are racing a clock.
• **The House Edge:** Market makers and institutional traders have better data, faster execution, and mathematical models. You are playing against professionals.
• **Overconfidence:** Options profits feel so large that traders size up their bets and eventually take a catastrophic loss that wipes out months of gains.
• **Complexity:** Implied volatility, Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega), and spread strategies add layers most beginners do not understand.

The options market transfers money from overconfident beginners to patient, disciplined professionals.

#### Screen 4: The Bottom Line
Options are a legitimate financial tool used by professionals for hedging and income strategies. But for beginners, they are extremely risky.

**If you are still building your investment foundation:**
• Focus on index funds and long-term compounding first.
• Do not trade options until you have a fully funded emergency fund and a solid core portfolio.
• If you do explore options, start only with money you can afford to lose completely.

**Never trade options with:**
• Rent or bill money
• Emergency fund money
• Student loan or borrowed money
• Money you need within the next 1-2 years

WARNING: Most retail traders lose money on options. Treat it as an advanced strategy, not a shortcut to wealth.

#### Quiz
1. What is an Options contract?
   - A. A type of savings account
   - B. A bet on the future price of a stock [Correct]
   - C. A company's stock
   - D. A government bond

2. A 'Call Option' is a bet that the price will:
   - A. Go DOWN
   - B. Stay the same
   - C. Go UP [Correct]
   - D. Not change for 1 year

3. Why are options considered risky?
   - A. They are boring
   - B. Small stock moves can mean 100% loss [Correct]
   - C. They have no fees
   - D. They are guaranteed to profit

### Lesson 3: S&P 500 in Dollars vs Gold
Lesson ID: `lesson-8-3`
Type: interactive
XP Reward: 45
Description: See nominal returns, dollar depreciation, and why currency strength matters.

#### Screen 1: Nominal Returns vs Real Value
The S&P 500 can rise strongly in dollar terms while the dollar itself loses purchasing power over time.

That is why investors compare:
• Asset returns in USD (nominal view)
• Asset returns in hard assets like gold
• Dollar purchasing power over time

#### Screen 2: Read the Chart
This chart shows 2000-2024 trends:
• **S&P in USD** (indexed)
• **S&P in gold terms** (indexed)
• **Dollar purchasing power** (indexed)

If the dollar-power line trends down, idle cash buys less over time.

#### Screen 3: High-Value vs Low-Value Currency
**High-value currency (relative strength):**
• Imports are cheaper
• Consumers gain global purchasing power
• Inflation pressure from imports may ease
• Export competitiveness can weaken

**Low-value currency (relative weakness):**
• Exports can become more competitive
• Domestic tourism/export industries may benefit
• Imports become more expensive
• Inflation pressure can rise

#### Screen 4: Practical Takeaway
Hold enough cash for near-term needs and emergencies.

But long-term idle cash usually loses ground to inflation.

For long horizons, pair cash management with assets that have the potential to outpace inflation.

#### Quiz
1. Why compare S&P 500 returns in gold terms as well as dollar terms?
   - A. Because gold always outperforms stocks
   - B. To view performance in a different denominator, not only nominal dollars [Correct]
   - C. Because dollar prices are always wrong
   - D. To avoid tracking inflation

2. What does a long-term decline in dollar purchasing-power index suggest?
   - A. Idle cash buys more over time
   - B. Inflation has eroded cash purchasing power [Correct]
   - C. Stocks become risk-free
   - D. Imports always get cheaper

3. A relatively strong (high-value) currency typically does what?
   - A. Makes exports more competitive automatically
   - B. Makes imports cheaper but can pressure exporters [Correct]
   - C. Eliminates inflation permanently
   - D. Guarantees higher GDP growth

### Lesson 4: China's Economic Rise: Export-First Model
Lesson ID: `lesson-8-4`
Type: interactive
XP Reward: 45
Description: How China scaled through exports and high savings compared with U.S. consumers.

#### Screen 1: Export-First Strategy
China's growth model leaned heavily on manufacturing and exports for decades.

Core idea:
• Build industrial capacity
• Keep production costs competitive
• Sell large volumes to global markets

This export-first approach helped China move from low-cost manufacturing into higher-value sectors over time.

#### Screen 2: Exports: China vs U.S.
Use the chart to compare exports as a share of GDP.

China generally ran a higher export share than the U.S., reflecting a more production-and-trade oriented model.

The U.S. has historically been more consumption-led, with household spending playing a larger role in growth.

#### Screen 3: Savings Rate Gap
China's households have typically saved a much larger share of income than U.S. consumers.

Why this matters:
• Higher savings can support higher domestic investment
• Lower savings can support stronger near-term consumption

Different savings behavior tends to produce different economic structures.

#### Screen 4: Tradeoffs and Takeaways
Export-first + high savings can accelerate industrial growth, but may rely more on external demand.

Consumer-first + lower savings can boost domestic demand, but may reduce investment buffer over time.

For learners: national strategy affects jobs, wages, exchange rates, and investment opportunities.

#### Quiz
1. What does 'export-first' generally mean in the context of China's rise?
   - A. Growth led primarily by foreign demand and manufactured exports [Correct]

### Lesson 2: Cryptocurrency: The Reality of Financialization
Lesson ID: `lesson-9-2`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 50
Description: The shift from decentralized money to speculative asset.

#### Content
**Cryptocurrency** (like Bitcoin) originally promised a decentralized alternative to the traditional financial system.
The vision was a trustless, peer-to-peer network free from banks and governments.
However, the current reality of crypto in 2026 is heavily **financialized**. The introduction of Spot ETFs, massive institutional buying, and centralized exchanges have largely defeated its original decentralized purpose.
Instead of acting as an independent currency, crypto has largely become another highly volatile, speculative asset class heavily tied to traditional markets and centralized platforms.
Pro tip: If you buy crypto, you need a **Wallet**. Remember: 'Not your keys, not your coins'. If you don't control the private keys, you don't truly own the assets.

#### Quiz
1. What was the original vision for cryptocurrency?
   - A. To be controlled by the government
   - B. To be a decentralized alternative to traditional finance [Correct]
   - C. To become a heavily financialized asset class
   - D. To be exclusively traded by institutions

2. Which of the following describes the reality of crypto in 2026?
   - A. It has completely replaced traditional banks
   - B. It is heavily financialized and tied to traditional markets [Correct]
   - C. It is only used for illegal activities

### Lesson 3: Prediction Markets
Lesson ID: `lesson-9-3`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 50
Description: Betting on the future.

#### Content
**Prediction Markets** let people bet on the outcome of real-world events (elections, sports, scientific breakthrough).
The price of a 'share' (e.g., 60 cents) represents the market's estimated probability (60%) of that event happening.
Many economists believe these markets are more accurate than polls or experts because participants have 'skin in the game'.
It's a way to use the 'Wisdom of the Crowd' to forecast the future.

#### Quiz
1. What do prediction markets allow people to do?
   - A. Predict the stock market with certainty
   - B. Bet on the outcome of real-world events [Correct]
   - C. Guarantee investment returns
   - D. Control the economy

2. If a prediction market share costs 60 cents, what probability does the market estimate?
   - A. 6%
   - B. 60% [Correct]
   - C. 100%
   - D. 0.6%

### Lesson 4: Tokenization of Assets
Lesson ID: `lesson-9-4`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 60
Description: The real-world utility of blockchain in traditional finance.

#### Content
**Tokenization** is the process of representing a real-world asset (like real estate, art, Treasury bills, or private equity) as a digital token on a blockchain.
By 2026, while the speculative frenzy of early crypto has waned, the underlying technology has been heavily adopted by **Traditional Finance (TradFi)**.
Major financial institutions use tokenization for its massive utility: faster settlement times, 24/7 trading, fractional ownership, and automated compliance through smart contracts.
Unlike early cryptocurrencies that tried to replace the financial system, tokenization is upgrading the plumbing of the existing financial system, bringing trillions of dollars of traditional assets on-chain.

#### Quiz
1. What is tokenization?
   - A. A new type of physical cryptocurrency coin
   - B. Representing a real-world asset as a digital token on a blockchain [Correct]
   - C. A tax placed on digital transfers
   - D. A password used for banking

2. How has Traditional Finance (TradFi) responded to tokenization by 2026?
   - A. They have banned its use completely
   - B. They have heavily adopted it for massive utility like faster settlement and 24/7 trading [Correct]
   - C. They ignored it as a fad
   - D. They only use it for meme stocks

3. Unlike early cryptocurrencies that aimed to replace the financial system, tokenization is primarily:
   - A. Upgrading the plumbing of the existing financial system [Correct]
   - B. Replacing all government currencies
   - C. Making all financial transactions anonymous
   - D. Eliminating the need for any smart contracts

## Module 12: Banking & Financial Institutions
Module ID: `module-10`
Description: Understand the entities that move the world's money.

### Lesson 1: Financial Pillars: Banks & Credit Unions
Lesson ID: `lesson-10-1`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 40
Description: Where should you keep your cash?

#### Content
**Traditional Banks** are for-profit corporations owned by shareholders. They offer convenience, many branches, and advanced tech, but often have higher fees.

**Credit Unions** are non-profit cooperatives owned by their members. They usually offer better interest rates and lower fees, but membership is often restricted to certain groups (e.g., teachers, military).

**Online-Only Banks** have no physical branches. Because they have lower overhead, they often offer the highest savings rates (**HYSA**) in the market.

Pro tip: Always ensure your bank is insured by the **FDIC** (for banks) or **NCUA** (for credit unions). This protects your money up to $250,000 if the institution fails.

#### Quiz
1. What is the primary difference between a Bank and a Credit Union?
   - A. Banks are non-profit, Credit Unions are for-profit
   - B. Banks are shareholder-owned, Credit Unions are member-owned [Correct]
   - C. Banks don't have physical branches
   - D. Credit Unions are not insured

2. What does FDIC insurance protect?
   - A. Your stock portfolio
   - B. Your bank deposits up to $250,000 [Correct]
   - C. Your credit score
   - D. Your car insurance premium

3. Why do online-only banks often offer higher interest rates (HYSA)?
   - A. They are less safe
   - B. They have lower overhead costs [Correct]
   - C. They don't use the FDIC
   - D. They only lend to billionaires

### Lesson 2: Green Banks: Financing the Future
Lesson ID: `lesson-10-2`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 50
Description: Using finance to fight climate change.

#### Content
A **Green Bank** is a mission-driven institution that uses public funds to 'de-risk' and attract private investment into clean energy projects.

**Why do we need them?** Traditional banks are often hesitant to fund new green technologies (like community solar or building retrofits) because they lack historical data to predict risk.

**How they work**: For every $1 of public money a Green Bank invests, it typically attracts $3 to $10 of private capital from institutional investors.

Examples include the **Connecticut Green Bank** (the first in the US) and the new federal **Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund**, which is deploying $27 billion to green projects across America.

#### Quiz
1. What is the main goal of a Green Bank?
   - A. To print green-colored money
   - B. To use public funds to attract private investment in clean energy [Correct]
   - C. To only lend to organic farmers
   - D. To replace the Federal Reserve

2. Why might a traditional bank refuse to fund a green project?
   - A. They hate the environment
   - B. They lack historical data to accurately predict the risk [Correct]
   - C. Green projects are illegal
   - D. They only fund oil companies

### Lesson 3: Global Stability: IMF & World Bank
Lesson ID: `lesson-10-3`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 60
Description: The lenders of last resort.

#### Content
The **International Monetary Fund (IMF)** acts as a global monitor and 'lender of last resort.' It provides loans to countries facing economic crises to prevent global contagion.

The **World Bank** focuses on long-term economic development and poverty reduction. It funds infrastructure projects like schools, bridges, and power plants in developing nations.

**Common Criticism**: Both institutions are often criticized for the 'conditions' they attach to loans, which may require countries to make painful cuts to social programs.

Despite controversies, these institutions are the backbone of global financial stability during times of war or total economic collapse.

#### Quiz
1. What is the primary role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)?
   - A. Building schools in poor villages
   - B. Acting as a global 'lender of last resort' for countries in crisis [Correct]

## Module 13: Homebuying & Mortgages
Module ID: `module-11`
Description: Navigate the biggest purchase of your life.

### Lesson 1: How Mortgages Work
Lesson ID: `lesson-11-1`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 35
Description: Fixed vs. adjustable, amortization, and pre-approval.

#### Screen 1: What Is a Mortgage?
A **mortgage** is a loan specifically for buying property. The property itself serves as **collateral**—if you stop paying, the bank can take your home (foreclosure).

Most mortgages last **15 or 30 years**. You pay monthly, and each payment covers two things:
• **Principal**: Paying down the actual loan amount.
• **Interest**: The cost of borrowing the money.

In the early years, most of your payment goes toward **interest**. Over time, more goes toward **principal**. This is called **amortization**.

#### Screen 2: Fixed-Rate vs. Adjustable-Rate
**Fixed-Rate Mortgage (FRM)**:
• Your interest rate NEVER changes for the life of the loan.
• Your monthly payment stays the same. Predictable and safe.
• Most popular choice: the **30-year fixed**.

**Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)**:
• Starts with a lower 'teaser' rate for 5-7 years.
• After that, the rate adjusts based on market conditions—it can go UP significantly.
• Example: A **5/1 ARM** has a fixed rate for 5 years, then adjusts every 1 year.

**Rule of Thumb**: If you plan to stay in the home long-term, go fixed. If you'll sell within 5-7 years, an ARM might save you money.

#### Screen 3: Getting Pre-Approved
Before you shop for a home, get **pre-approved** by a lender.

Pre-approval tells you exactly how much you can borrow. It also shows sellers you're a serious buyer.

**What lenders look at:**
• **Credit Score**: 740+ gets the best rates.
• **Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Your monthly debts divided by your gross income. Lenders want this below 43%.
• **Employment History**: Stable income for at least 2 years.
• **Assets**: Savings for down payment and reserves.

Pro tip: Get pre-approved by 2-3 lenders and compare offers. Even a 0.25% rate difference saves thousands over 30 years.

#### Quiz
1. What are the two components of every mortgage payment?
   - A. Tax and insurance
   - B. Principal and interest [Correct]
   - C. Down payment and closing costs
   - D. PMI and HOA

2. What is a 5/1 ARM?
   - A. A fixed-rate mortgage for 5 years
   - B. A loan with 5% interest
   - C. Fixed rate for 5 years, then adjusts every 1 year [Correct]
   - D. A 5-year mortgage

3. What should your Debt-to-Income ratio be below for most lenders?
   - A. 20%
   - B. 33%
   - C. 43% [Correct]
   - D. 60%

### Lesson 2: Down Payments, PMI & Closing Costs
Lesson ID: `lesson-11-2`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 30
Description: The upfront costs most people underestimate.

#### Screen 1: The Down Payment Myth
Many people think you need **20% down** to buy a home. That's a myth.

• **Conventional loans**: As low as 3% down.
• **FHA loans**: 3.5% down (popular for first-time buyers).
• **VA loans**: 0% down for eligible veterans.
• **USDA loans**: 0% down for rural areas.

On a $300,000 home:
• 20% down = $60,000
• 3% down = $9,000

The catch? If you put less than 20% down, you'll likely pay **PMI**.

#### Screen 2: What Is PMI?
**Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)** protects the LENDER (not you) if you default on the loan.

PMI typically costs **0.5% to 1%** of the loan amount per year.

On a $285,000 loan (after 5% down on a $300k home):
• PMI ≈ $120-$240/month on top of your mortgage payment.

**The good news**: PMI goes away once you reach 20% equity in your home. You can request removal at that point.

Pro tip: Some lenders offer **lender-paid PMI** in exchange for a slightly higher interest rate. Do the math to see which is cheaper over your expected time in the home.

#### Screen 3: Closing Costs: The Hidden Bill
On top of the down payment, you'll pay **closing costs** — typically **2-5% of the home price**.

On a $300,000 home, that's $6,000-$15,000.

**What's included:**
• Loan origination fees
• Appraisal fee ($300-$500)
• Title insurance and search
• Attorney fees
• Prepaid property taxes and homeowner's insurance
• Recording fees

Pro tip: You can negotiate with the seller to cover some closing costs (a 'seller concession'). This is more common in buyer's markets.

#### Quiz
1. What is PMI?
   - A. A type of home warranty
   - B. Insurance that protects the LENDER if you default [Correct]
   - C. Insurance that protects YOU from losing the home
   - D. A property tax

2. At what equity percentage can you typically request PMI removal?
   - A. 5%
   - B. 10%
   - C. 15%
   - D. 20% [Correct]

3. Closing costs typically range from what percentage of the home price?
   - A. 0-1%
   - B. 2-5% [Correct]
   - C. 10-15%
   - D. 20-25%

### Lesson 3: Rent vs. Buy: The Real Math
Lesson ID: `lesson-11-3`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 40
Description: It's not as simple as "renting is throwing money away."

#### Screen 1: The Renting Myth
You've probably heard: **'Renting is throwing money away.'** This is an oversimplification.

When you rent, you pay for a place to live and that's it. No maintenance, no property taxes, no surprise repairs.

When you own, your mortgage payment builds equity—but you ALSO pay:
• Property taxes (1-2% of home value/year)
• Homeowner's insurance
• Maintenance (budget 1-2% of home value/year)
• PMI (if less than 20% down)
• HOA fees (if applicable)

The 'hidden' costs of ownership are significant.

#### Screen 2: The Break-Even Calculation
The key question is: **How long do you plan to stay?**

Buying has high upfront costs (down payment, closing costs). It usually takes **5-7 years** to break even compared to renting.

**If you'll move within 3 years**: Renting almost always wins.
**If you'll stay 7+ years**: Buying usually wins.
**4-6 years**: It depends on your local market.

Other factors:
• Is your local rent increasing fast? Buying locks in your housing cost.
• Could you invest the down payment instead? At 10% returns, $60,000 becomes ~$97,000 in 5 years.

There's no universal answer. Run the numbers for YOUR situation.

#### Quiz
1. How many years does it typically take for buying to break even vs. renting?
   - A. 1-2 years
   - B. 3-4 years
   - C. 5-7 years [Correct]
   - D. 10+ years

2. 'Renting is throwing money away' is:
   - A. Always true
   - B. Always false
   - C. An oversimplification [Correct]
   - D. A proven financial law

3. If you plan to move within 3 years, which option usually wins?
   - A. Buying
   - B. Renting [Correct]
   - C. It doesn't matter
   - D. Leasing

### Lesson 4: Hidden Costs of Homeownership
Lesson ID: `lesson-11-4`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 30
Description: What the listing price doesn't tell you.

#### Screen 1: The 1% Rule
A common rule: budget **1-2% of your home's value per year** for maintenance and repairs.

On a $300,000 home, that's $3,000-$6,000/year ($250-$500/month).

**Common surprise costs:**
• New roof: $8,000-$15,000
• HVAC replacement: $5,000-$10,000
• Foundation repair: $5,000-$30,000
• Water heater: $1,000-$3,000
• Plumbing emergency: $500-$5,000

These costs don't ask if it's a good time. They just happen.

#### Screen 2: Property Taxes, HOA & Insurance
**Property Taxes** vary wildly by location:
• New Jersey: ~2.2% of home value/year
• Texas: ~1.7%
• Hawaii: ~0.3%

On a $300,000 home in Texas, that's ~$5,100/year ($425/month).

**HOA Fees** (if in a community with one):
• Typically $200-$500/month
• Can include landscaping, pool, exterior maintenance
• HOA can restrict what you do with YOUR property

**Homeowner's Insurance**: $1,500-$3,000/year depending on location and coverage.

Pro tip: Add up ALL these costs before deciding what you can 'afford'. A home that fits your mortgage budget might not fit your TOTAL budget.

#### Quiz
1. The 1% Rule suggests budgeting what amount annually for home maintenance?
   - A. 1% of your income
   - B. 1-2% of your home's value [Correct]
   - C. 1% of your mortgage payment
   - D. $1,000 flat

2. Which state has among the HIGHEST property tax rates?
   - A. Hawaii
   - B. Texas
   - C. Florida
   - D. New Jersey [Correct]

3. Before deciding what you can 'afford,' you should:
   - A. Only look at the mortgage payment
   - B. Add up ALL costs (taxes, insurance, maintenance, HOA) [Correct]
   - C. Trust the real estate agent's estimate
   - D. Ignore property taxes

### Lesson 5: Condo vs Townhouse: The True Monthly Cost
Lesson ID: `lesson-11-5`
Type: interactive
XP Reward: 40
Description: Compare HOAs, taxes, insurance, repairs, and market differences across the U.S.

#### Screen 1: Condo vs Townhouse Basics
**Condo**:
• You typically own the interior of your unit.
• Shared areas (roof, exterior, hallways, amenities) are managed by an HOA/association.
• Usually higher HOA fees, often lower individual exterior maintenance burden.

**Townhouse**:
• You usually own the unit plus some land footprint.
• More responsibility for structure/exterior, depending on the HOA rules.
• Often lower HOA than condos, but potentially higher repair responsibility.

Key point: The mortgage payment alone does NOT tell you which option is cheaper.

#### Screen 2: HOA Fees: Help or Headache?
HOA fees can pay for useful services:
• Exterior maintenance
• Landscaping and snow removal
• Shared amenities (pool, gym, security)

But HOAs can also create risks:
• Fee increases
• Special assessments for major repairs
• Rules and restrictions (rentals, renovations, use of space)

Always review HOA financial statements, reserve levels, and meeting notes before buying.

#### Screen 3: Why Non-Mortgage Costs Matter
Your total monthly housing cost includes:
• Principal + interest (mortgage)
• Property taxes
• Homeowner's insurance
• Routine repair budget
• HOA dues

In some markets, taxes + insurance + repairs + HOA can rival or even exceed your principal+interest payment.

Use the calculator to test scenarios and see where the hidden costs overtake the mortgage.

#### Screen 4: Property Markets Are Not the Same
Home markets vary across the U.S. because of:
• Home prices
• Property tax rates
• Insurance risk (storms, wildfire, flood)
• HOA prevalence and fee levels

A payment that works in one city may fail in another, even for a similar home price.

Use market presets in the calculator to compare how cost structure changes by region.

#### Screen 5: Buyer Checklist
Before making an offer:
1) Compare condo and townhouse total monthly cost, not just P+I.
2) Stress-test for HOA increases and large repair years.
3) Estimate taxes and insurance with local quotes, not national averages.
4) Keep a repair reserve even after closing.
5) Buy based on a sustainable monthly budget, not lender maximum.

#### Quiz
1. Which home type usually has HIGHER HOA fees but lower direct exterior maintenance responsibility for the owner?
   - A. Condo [Correct]
   - B. Townhouse
   - C. Single-family with no HOA
   - D. All are always equal

2. Which statement is most accurate about monthly homeownership costs?
   - A. Mortgage principal+interest is the only cost that matters
   - B. Taxes, insurance, repairs, and HOA can rival or exceed principal+interest in some markets [Correct]
   - C. HOA dues are optional after closing
   - D. Property taxes are the same in every U.S. market

3. Why do property markets differ across the U.S.?
   - A. Only because mortgage rates are different
   - B. Only because of home size
   - C. Because prices, taxes, insurance risk, and HOA structures vary by region [Correct]
   - D. They do not differ much in practice

Description: Demystifying the tax system for young earners.

### Lesson 1: How Tax Brackets Actually Work
Lesson ID: `lesson-12-1`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 35
Description: Marginal vs. effective rates — the #1 misunderstanding.

#### Screen 1: The Biggest Tax Myth
**MYTH**: 'If I earn more, I'll move into a higher tax bracket and take home LESS money.'

**FACT**: That's NOT how it works. The US uses a **marginal tax system**.

This means only the income WITHIN each bracket is taxed at that rate. Earning more ALWAYS means more take-home pay.

Example (2024 brackets for single filers):
• $0 - $11,600: taxed at **10%**
• $11,601 - $47,150: taxed at **12%**
• $47,151 - $100,525: taxed at **22%**
• $100,526 - $191,950: taxed at **24%**

#### Screen 2: Marginal vs. Effective Rate
If you earn **$60,000**:

• First $11,600 × 10% = $1,160
• Next $35,550 × 12% = $4,266
• Last $12,850 × 22% = $2,827

**Total tax: $8,253**

Your **marginal rate** is 22% (the highest bracket you touch).
Your **effective rate** is ~13.8% ($8,253 ÷ $60,000).

You're NOT paying 22% on all $60,000 — only on the portion above $47,150.

Never turn down a raise because of tax brackets!

#### Quiz
1. In a marginal tax system, earning more money means:
   - A. You could take home less
   - B. Only the income in the higher bracket is taxed at that rate [Correct]
   - C. All your income is taxed at the highest rate
   - D. You pay a flat tax

2. If your marginal rate is 22% and your effective rate is 13.8%, what does that mean?
   - A. You pay 22% on all income
   - B. You pay 13.8% overall, with only income above a threshold at 22% [Correct]
   - C. You owe 35.8% total
   - D. The rates are unrelated

3. Should you ever turn down a raise because of tax brackets?
   - A. Yes, you might earn less
   - B. Only if it's a small raise
   - C. No — earning more always means more take-home pay [Correct]
   - D. It depends on your state

### Lesson 2: W-2 vs. 1099 Income
Lesson ID: `lesson-12-2`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 30
Description: Employee vs. contractor — know the difference.

#### Screen 1: W-2: Traditional Employment
If you work for a company as an **employee**, you receive a **W-2** form.

**What your employer handles for you:**
• Withholds federal and state income taxes
• Pays half of your Social Security and Medicare taxes (7.65%)
• May offer benefits: health insurance, 401k match, PTO

You pay the other half of Social Security/Medicare (7.65%), which is automatically deducted from your paycheck.

**Total FICA tax burden as W-2: 7.65%**

#### Screen 2: 1099: Independent Contractor
If you freelance or contract, you receive a **1099** form.

**Key differences:**
• No taxes are withheld — YOU must pay quarterly estimated taxes.
• You pay BOTH halves of Social Security/Medicare = **15.3%** (self-employment tax).
• No employer-provided benefits.

**The upside:**
• You can deduct business expenses (home office, equipment, mileage).
• You can use a **SEP IRA** or **Solo 401k** — often with higher contribution limits.
• More control over your schedule and rates.

Pro tip: If you're 1099, set aside **25-30%** of every payment for taxes. Open a separate savings account just for this.

#### Quiz
1. As a 1099 independent contractor, your total FICA self-employment tax is:
   - A. 7.65%
   - B. 10%
   - C. 15.3% [Correct]

2. What percentage of each payment should 1099 workers set aside for taxes?
   - A. 5-10%
   - B. 15-20%
   - C. 25-30% [Correct]
   - D. 50%

3. Which is an advantage of 1099 work?
   - A. Employer pays half your FICA
   - B. Automatic tax withholding
   - C. Ability to deduct business expenses [Correct]
   - D. Guaranteed benefits

Type: reading
XP Reward: 35
Description: Legal ways to reduce your tax bill.

#### Screen 1: Standard vs. Itemized Deductions
A **deduction** reduces your **taxable income**. Less taxable income = lower tax bill.

You choose ONE:
• **Standard Deduction** (2024): $14,600 for single filers, $29,200 for married filing jointly.
• **Itemized Deductions**: Add up specific expenses (mortgage interest, state/local taxes, charitable donations).

**Most people take the standard deduction.** It's simpler and usually larger after the 2017 tax law changes.

You should itemize if your deductible expenses exceed the standard deduction — common for homeowners with big mortgages.

#### Screen 2: Credits: Even Better Than Deductions
A **tax credit** reduces your actual tax bill dollar-for-dollar. Credits are more valuable than deductions.

**Common credits:**
• **Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)**: Up to $7,430 for low-to-moderate income workers.
• **American Opportunity Credit**: Up to $2,500/year for college expenses (first 4 years).
• **Child Tax Credit**: $2,000 per qualifying child.
• **Saver's Credit**: Up to $1,000 for contributing to a retirement account (low income).
• **EV Tax Credit**: Up to $7,500 for buying a qualifying electric vehicle.

A $1,000 deduction in the 22% bracket saves you $220.
A $1,000 credit saves you **$1,000**.

Always claim every credit you qualify for!

#### Quiz
1. What is the difference between a tax deduction and a tax credit?
   - A. They are the same thing
   - B. A deduction reduces taxable income; a credit reduces your tax bill dollar-for-dollar [Correct]
   - C. A credit reduces taxable income; a deduction reduces your tax bill
   - D. Neither affects how much you owe

2. A $1,000 tax credit saves you more money than a $1,000 deduction because:
   - A. Credits are illegal
   - B. A credit reduces your tax bill by $1,000; a deduction only saves you your marginal rate on $1,000 [Correct]
   - C. Deductions are worth more
   - D. They save the same amount

3. Most Americans should take the _____ deduction.
   - A. Itemized
   - B. Standard [Correct]
   - C. Business
   - D. Foreign

### Lesson 4: Tax-Advantaged Accounts
Lesson ID: `lesson-12-4`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 40
Description: 401k, IRA, Roth, HSA — free money from the government.

#### Screen 1: Pre-Tax Accounts: 401k & Traditional IRA
**Pre-tax** accounts let you contribute money BEFORE it's taxed. Your taxable income drops immediately.

**401k** (through your employer):
• 2024 contribution limit: $23,000/year.
• Many employers **match** your contributions (e.g., 50% match up to 6% of salary).
• Employer match = **FREE MONEY**. Always contribute enough to get the full match.

**Traditional IRA** (on your own):
• 2024 limit: $7,000/year ($8,000 if 50+).
• Tax-deductible if you meet income requirements.

**The catch**: You pay income tax when you withdraw in retirement.

#### Screen 2: Roth Accounts & the HSA Triple Tax Advantage
**Roth IRA / Roth 401k:**
• You contribute AFTER-TAX money (no immediate tax break).
• But all growth and withdrawals in retirement are **100% TAX-FREE**.
• Best for young earners who expect higher income later.

**Health Savings Account (HSA)** — the ULTIMATE tax hack:
• ✅ Contributions are tax-deductible (pre-tax).
• ✅ Growth is tax-free.
• ✅ Withdrawals for medical expenses are tax-free.
• 2024 limit: $4,150 (individual) / $8,300 (family).

After age 65, you can withdraw HSA funds for ANY purpose (taxed like a Traditional IRA). It's basically a **super IRA**.

**Priority order**: 1) 401k up to employer match → 2) Max HSA → 3) Max Roth IRA → 4) Max remaining 401k.

#### Quiz
1. What makes the HSA the 'ultimate tax hack'?
   - A. It has no contribution limit
   - B. Triple tax advantage: pre-tax in, tax-free growth, tax-free medical withdrawals [Correct]
   - C. It replaces your 401k
   - D. It's only for retirees

2. What's the recommended priority order for tax-advantaged accounts?
   - A. Max Roth IRA first
   - B. 401k match → HSA → Roth IRA → remaining 401k [Correct]
   - C. HSA only
   - D. Traditional IRA → 401k

3. An employer 401k match is best described as:
   - A. A loan
   - B. Free money [Correct]
   - C. A tax penalty
   - D. An insurance benefit

### Lesson 5: HSA Deep Dive: The Triple Tax Advantage
Lesson ID: `lesson-12-5`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 45
Description: How Health Savings Accounts can function as both healthcare and long-term wealth tools.

#### Screen 1: Who Can Use an HSA?
An **HSA (Health Savings Account)** is available if you're enrolled in a qualifying **High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)**.

General eligibility rules:
• You must be covered by an HSA-qualified HDHP.
• You typically cannot be claimed as someone else's tax dependent.
• Once enrolled in Medicare, new HSA contributions are no longer allowed.

Think of an HSA as a long-term account designed for healthcare costs, but with powerful tax treatment that can make it useful far beyond annual doctor visits.

#### Screen 2: The Triple Tax Advantage (Why It Matters)
HSAs are one of the few accounts with **three tax benefits**:

1) **Contributions are tax-advantaged** (pre-tax via payroll or deductible if contributed directly).
2) **Growth is tax-free** (interest, dividends, and gains are not taxed while inside the account).
3) **Qualified medical withdrawals are tax-free**.

Most accounts only give you one or two of these benefits. HSA gives all three, which is why many investors treat it as a 'stealth retirement account' for future healthcare expenses.

#### Screen 3: Two Practical HSA Strategies
**Strategy A: Spend-Now**
• Use the HSA for current medical costs.
• Helpful when cash flow is tight.

**Strategy B: Invest-and-Reimburse-Later**
• Pay current medical bills out of pocket.
• Keep receipts.
• Leave HSA funds invested to compound.
• Reimburse yourself later for qualified expenses (with proper documentation).

If you can afford Strategy B, it can significantly increase long-term tax-efficient growth.

#### Screen 4: Best Practices and Pitfalls
HSA best practices:
• Contribute consistently (limits are adjusted by the IRS each year).
• Invest HSA balances above your short-term medical cash buffer.
• Track and store medical receipts carefully.

Common pitfalls:
• Using HSA funds for non-qualified expenses before age 65 (taxes + penalty can apply).
• Leaving large balances in near-zero-interest cash when investing is available.
• Missing employer HSA contributions that are part of your compensation package.

Action step: Review your health plan type and HSA contribution setup this week. Even small contributions can compound meaningfully over time.

#### Quiz
1. What is the core reason HSAs are considered powerful wealth-building tools?
   - A. They guarantee stock market returns
   - B. They offer triple tax advantage [Correct]
   - C. They have unlimited contributions
   - D. They replace health insurance

2. Which strategy maximizes long-term HSA compounding for many people?
   - A. Spend all HSA dollars immediately
   - B. Keep HSA funds in cash forever
   - C. Pay medical expenses out-of-pocket, keep receipts, and let HSA stay invested [Correct]
   - D. Withdraw HSA funds for non-medical spending before 65

3. Which is a common HSA pitfall?
   - A. Tracking medical receipts
   - B. Contributing through payroll
   - C. Using funds for non-qualified expenses before age 65 [Correct]
   - D. Investing a portion for long-term growth

## Module 15: Student Loans & Education ROI
Module ID: `module-13`
Description: Navigate the $1.7 trillion student debt crisis.

### Lesson 1: Federal vs. Private Loans
Lesson ID: `lesson-13-1`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 35
Description: Know your protections before you borrow.

#### Screen 1: Federal Student Loans
**Federal loans** come from the U.S. government and offer critical protections that private loans don't.

**Types of Federal Loans:**
• **Direct Subsidized**: For undergrads with financial need. The government pays interest while you're in school.
• **Direct Unsubsidized**: Available to all students. Interest accrues immediately.
• **PLUS Loans**: For parents or grad students. Higher rates, fewer protections.

**Key protections:**
• Income-driven repayment plans
• Loan forgiveness programs (PSLF)
• Deferment and forbearance options
• No credit check for most loans (except PLUS)

**Current rates (2024):** ~5.5% for undergrad, ~7% for grad, ~8.5% for PLUS.

#### Screen 2: Private Student Loans
**Private loans** come from banks, credit unions, or online lenders.

**Key differences from federal:**
• Interest rates vary: 4-14% depending on credit score.
• Require a credit check (often need a cosigner as a student).
• NO income-driven repayment plans.
• NO loan forgiveness programs.
• Limited hardship options.

**When to consider private loans:**
• Only AFTER maxing out federal loans.
• If you have excellent credit and can get a lower rate.

**FAFSA first!** Always fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid before considering private loans. It's free and determines your eligibility for grants, scholarships, and federal loans.

Pro tip: Grants and scholarships are free money. Exhaust those before borrowing anything.

#### Quiz
1. Which type of federal loan has the government pay interest while you're in school?
   - A. Direct Unsubsidized
   - B. PLUS Loan
   - C. Direct Subsidized [Correct]
   - D. Private loan

   - A. Private loans
   - B. Federal loans [Correct]
   - C. Payday loans
   - D. Personal loans

### Lesson 2: Repayment Strategies
Lesson ID: `lesson-13-2`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 35
Description: Standard, income-driven, avalanche vs. snowball.

#### Screen 1: Federal Repayment Plans
**Standard Repayment**: Fixed payments over 10 years. Highest monthly payment but lowest total interest.

**Income-Driven Repayment (IDR)**:
• Payments capped at 10-20% of your discretionary income.
• Remaining balance forgiven after 20-25 years.
• **SAVE Plan** (newest): Often the lowest payments for most borrowers.

**Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)**:
• Work for a government or non-profit employer.
• Make 120 qualifying payments (10 years) on an IDR plan.
• Remaining balance forgiven TAX-FREE.

**Important**: IDR forgiveness (non-PSLF) may be taxed as income. PSLF forgiveness is not.

#### Screen 2: Avalanche vs. Snowball Method
If you have multiple loans, which do you pay off first?

**Avalanche Method** (mathematically optimal):
• Pay minimums on all loans.
• Put extra money toward the loan with the HIGHEST interest rate.
• Saves the most money overall.

**Snowball Method** (psychologically effective):
• Pay minimums on all loans.
• Put extra money toward the SMALLEST balance first.
• Eliminates individual loans faster, giving you motivational 'wins'.

**Which is better?** Avalanche saves more money. Snowball keeps you motivated. Pick the one you'll actually stick with.

Pro tip: Either method beats making only minimum payments.

#### Quiz
1. The Avalanche method prioritizes paying off loans with the:
   - A. Smallest balance
   - B. Largest balance
   - C. Highest interest rate [Correct]
   - D. Lowest interest rate

2. Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) requires how many qualifying payments?
   - A. 60 (5 years)
   - B. 120 (10 years) [Correct]
   - C. 240 (20 years)
   - D. 360 (30 years)

3. The Snowball method is popular because it:
   - A. Saves the most money
   - B. Provides motivational wins by eliminating small debts first [Correct]
   - C. Has the lowest payments
   - D. Is required by law

### Lesson 3: To Refinance or Not?
Lesson ID: `lesson-13-3`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 30
Description: When refinancing helps — and when it hurts.

#### Screen 1: What Is Refinancing?
**Refinancing** means replacing your current loan(s) with a new private loan at a different interest rate.

**When it makes sense:**
• You have high-interest private loans and your credit has improved.

• You have stable income and an emergency fund.

**When it's a BAD idea:**
• You have **federal loans** and would lose IDR plans, PSLF eligibility, and forbearance options.
• You're pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness.
• Your income is unstable.

⚠️ **Critical warning**: Refinancing federal loans into a private loan is IRREVERSIBLE. You permanently lose all federal protections.

Pro tip: Only refinance federal loans if you have a very high income, strong job security, and no interest in forgiveness programs.

#### Quiz
1. Refinancing federal loans into a private loan is:
   - A. Easily reversible
   - B. Irreversible — you lose all federal protections [Correct]
   - C. Recommended for everyone
   - D. Required after graduation

2. When does refinancing make the MOST sense?
   - A. When you have federal loans and want PSLF
   - B. When your income is unstable
   - C. When you have high-interest private loans and improved credit [Correct]
   - D. When you just graduated

3. What protections do you lose when refinancing federal loans to private?
   - A. Nothing — private loans are better
   - B. IDR plans, PSLF eligibility, and forbearance [Correct]
   - C. Only the interest rate changes
   - D. Your degree

### Lesson 4: Is College Worth It?
Lesson ID: `lesson-13-4`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 40
Description: ROI by major, alternatives, and the real math.

#### Screen 1: The Numbers
On average, college graduates earn **$1.2 million more** over a lifetime than high school graduates.

But that's an AVERAGE. The ROI varies enormously by major and school:

**High ROI majors:**
• Computer Science: ~$1.1M lifetime earnings premium
• Engineering: ~$950K premium
• Nursing: ~$700K premium
• Business/Finance: ~$650K premium

**Lower ROI majors:**
• Fine Arts: ~$200K premium
• Education: ~$250K premium
• Social Work: ~$225K premium

These are averages — individual outcomes vary wildly.

#### Screen 2: Alternatives to 4-Year Degrees
College isn't the only path to a good career:

**Trade Schools** (6 months - 2 years):
• Electricians, plumbers, HVAC techs earn $50-$90k+
• Much lower tuition ($5k-$15k vs. $100k+)
• High demand, aging workforce = job security

**Coding Bootcamps** (3-6 months):
• Cost: $10k-$20k
• Entry-level developer salaries: $60k-$90k
• Quality varies widely — research outcomes carefully

**Community College → Transfer**:
• Complete 2 years at ~$3,500/year
• Transfer to a 4-year university for the same degree
• Save $30,000-$60,000+ in total tuition

**The bottom line**: The question isn't 'Is college worth it?' It's 'Is THIS degree at THIS cost worth it for MY career goals?'

#### Quiz
1. On average, college graduates earn how much more over a lifetime?
   - A. $100,000
   - B. $500,000

## Module 16: Salary Negotiation & Career Finance
Module ID: `module-14`
Description: Your career is your biggest asset — maximize it.

### Lesson 1: Know Your Market Value
Lesson ID: `lesson-14-1`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 35
Description: Research tools, salary ranges, and leveling.

#### Screen 1: You Are Underpaid (Probably)
Most people have NO IDEA what they're worth in the job market. This is by design — salary secrecy benefits employers.

**How to research your market value:**
• **Levels.fyi** — Best for tech. Shows total compensation by company and level.
• **Glassdoor** — Broad salary data across industries.
• **LinkedIn Salary** — Uses real member data.
• **Bureau of Labor Statistics** — Government data on wages by occupation and location.
• **H1B Salary Database** — Publicly available salaries companies pay visa holders.

**Key concept: Leveling**
Companies have internal 'levels' (e.g., Junior, Mid, Senior, Staff). Your title might be the same, but your level determines your pay band.

Pro tip: Always ask about the 'pay band' for your level during negotiations. It tells you the floor and ceiling.

#### Screen 2: Location & Industry Premium
The same job can pay VERY differently depending on where and who you work for.

**Software Engineer (mid-level) salaries:**
• San Francisco (Big Tech): $180k-$300k total comp
• Austin, TX (Mid-size tech): $120k-$180k
• Omaha, NE (Non-tech company): $80k-$120k
• Remote (varies by company policy): $100k-$250k

**Industry premiums:**
• Finance/Trading: Often 2x other industries
• Big Tech (FAANG): 1.5-2x average
• Government/Non-profit: 0.7-0.9x average

**Cost of living matters**: A $150k salary in San Francisco ≈ $90k in Dallas in terms of purchasing power.

Pro tip: Remote roles at companies that DON'T adjust for location are often the best deal.

#### Quiz
1. Salary secrecy primarily benefits:
   - A. Employees
   - B. Employers [Correct]
   - C. The government
   - D. Everyone equally

2. What is 'leveling' in the context of compensation?
   - A. Making everyone's salary equal
   - B. Internal company tiers that determine your pay band [Correct]
   - C. A negotiation tactic
   - D. A type of bonus

3. A $150k salary in San Francisco is roughly equivalent to what in Dallas?
   - A. $150k
   - B. $120k
   - C. $90k [Correct]
   - D. $200k

### Lesson 2: Negotiation Frameworks
Lesson ID: `lesson-14-2`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 40
Description: Anchoring, BATNA, and scripts that work.

#### Story
Character: Maya
Maya receives a job offer for $75,000. She's excited but nervous about negotiating. She doesn't want them to rescind the offer.

#### Screen 1: The Golden Rules
**Rule #1**: Almost every offer is negotiable. Companies EXPECT you to negotiate.

**Rule #2**: They will almost NEVER rescind an offer because you negotiated professionally. They've already invested thousands in hiring you.

**Rule #3**: The best time to negotiate is BEFORE you accept. Your leverage disappears after you say yes.

**Key concepts:**
• **Anchoring**: The first number sets the reference point. Always let them make the first offer.
• **BATNA** (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement): Your backup plan. Having another offer dramatically increases your leverage.
• **The Flinch**: When they name a number, pause. Let there be silence. They may improve the offer on their own.

#### Screen 2: Scripts That Work
**The Counter-Offer Script:**
"I'm very excited about this opportunity. Based on my research and the value I'll bring, I was hoping for something closer to $[target]. Is there flexibility here?"

**The Competing Offer Script:**
"I have another offer at $[amount]. I'd prefer to join your team, but I want to make sure the compensation is competitive. Can you match or improve on this?"

**The 'What Else' Script:**
"If the base salary is firm, are there other areas with flexibility? I'm thinking about signing bonus, equity, PTO, or remote work options."

**Pro tips:**
• Always negotiate via email (gives you time to think).
• Never say your current salary — it anchors you low.
• Ask for 10-20% more than you'd be happy with.
• Be warm, enthusiastic, and professional throughout.

#### Quiz
1. Companies almost never rescind job offers because you negotiate because:
   - A. It's illegal
   - B. They've already invested thousands in hiring you [Correct]
   - C. They don't care about salary
   - D. HR policies prevent it

2. What is BATNA?
   - A. A salary calculator
   - B. Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement [Correct]
   - C. A type of stock option
   - D. A tax deduction

3. When is the best time to negotiate compensation?
   - A. After your first day
   - B. During your annual review
   - C. Before you accept the offer [Correct]
   - D. After 6 months

### Lesson 3: Total Compensation
Lesson ID: `lesson-14-3`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 35
Description: Base salary is only part of the picture.

#### Screen 1: Beyond the Base
Your **total compensation** includes much more than your base salary:

**Cash Compensation:**
• Base salary (guaranteed)
• Annual bonus (often 10-30% of base, not always guaranteed)
• Signing bonus (one-time, often with a clawback if you leave early)

**Equity:**
• Stock options (right to buy shares at a set price)
• RSUs (Restricted Stock Units — actual shares granted over time)
• Equity typically vests over 4 years with a 1-year 'cliff'

**Benefits (real dollar value):**
• Health insurance (employer share: $5k-$15k/year)
• 401k match (if 50% match on 6%, that's 3% of your salary FREE)
• PTO/vacation days (each day ≈ salary / 260)

#### Screen 2: Comparing Two Offers
**Offer A**: $90k base, no equity, 5% bonus, basic insurance, 15 PTO days
**Offer B**: $80k base, $40k RSUs/year, 10% bonus, premium insurance, 25 PTO days

At first glance, Offer A looks better ($90k vs $80k).

**Total comp calculation:**
• Offer A: $90k + $4.5k bonus + $6k insurance = ~$100,500
• Offer B: $80k + $40k RSUs + $8k bonus + $12k insurance = ~$140,000

Offer B is worth **$40,000 more** per year.

**Always compare TOTAL compensation**, not just base salary.

Pro tip: Ask recruiters for the 'total compensation summary' or 'offer breakdown'. Most big companies provide one.

#### Quiz
1. RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) are:
   - A. A type of savings account
   - B. Actual company shares granted over time [Correct]
   - C. A retirement plan
   - D. A type of insurance

2. An offer with a lower base salary but significant equity and benefits:
   - A. Is always worse
   - B. Could have higher total compensation [Correct]
   - C. Should always be rejected
   - D. Isn't real compensation

3. When comparing offers, you should always compare:
   - A. Base salary only
   - B. Total compensation [Correct]
   - C. Company name recognition
   - D. Office location only

### Lesson 4: The Lifetime Cost of a Low Offer
Lesson ID: `lesson-14-4`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 35
Description: How a $5k raise compounds into a fortune.

#### Screen 1: The $5,000 Raise You Didn't Ask For
Imagine two people with identical jobs. One negotiated $5,000 more in their first offer.

Assuming **3% annual raises** for both:

After 5 years: $5,000 gap becomes ~$28,000 in cumulative extra earnings.
After 10 years: ~$60,000 cumulative difference.
After 20 years: ~$140,000 cumulative difference.
After 30 years: ~$250,000+ cumulative difference.

And that's just salary. If you invest the difference at 10%/year, the gap grows to **$500,000+** over a career.

One conversation. Five minutes of discomfort. Half a million dollars.

#### Screen 2: Never Stop Negotiating
Negotiation isn't just for job offers. Apply these skills to:

• **Annual reviews**: Document your wins. Ask for raises proactively, don't wait.
• **Promotions**: Ask your manager 'What specifically do I need to do to get promoted?' Then do it and follow up.
• **Medical bills**: Hospitals often discount 20-50% if you ask.
• **Rent**: Landlords would rather discount than find new tenants.
• **Cable/internet/phone**: Call and say 'I'm considering switching.' They'll often offer retention deals.
• **Car purchases**: Get quotes from 3+ dealers. Use them against each other.

**The uncomfortable truth**: People who negotiate earn $1M+ more over their lifetime than those who don't.

The skill of asking for what you're worth is the highest-ROI skill you'll ever develop.

#### Quiz
1. A $5,000 higher starting salary can compound to how much over a career?
   - A. $5,000
   - B. $50,000
   - C. $250,000+ [Correct]
   - D. It doesn't matter

2. People who negotiate earn roughly how much more over their lifetime?
   - A. $10,000
   - B. $100,000
   - C. $1 million+ [Correct]
   - D. The same amount

3. Which of these can you negotiate besides job offers?
   - A. Medical bills
   - B. Rent
   - C. Cable/internet bills
   - D. All of the above [Correct]

## Module 17: Emergency Funds & Financial Resilience
Module ID: `module-15`
Description: Build a safety net before things go wrong.

### Lesson 1: Why 3-6 Months Matters
Lesson ID: `lesson-15-1`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 30
Description: Emergency stats and the safety net math.

#### Screen 1: The Fragility Problem
**56% of Americans** cannot cover a $1,000 emergency expense with savings.

That means a single car repair, medical bill, or job loss can trigger a financial spiral: credit card debt → high interest → more debt → stress → poor decisions.

An **emergency fund** breaks this cycle. It's cash set aside ONLY for true emergencies:
• Job loss
• Medical emergencies
• Major car or home repairs
• Unexpected travel (family emergency)

**NOT emergencies:** Sales, vacations, new gadgets, concert tickets.

#### Screen 2: How Much Do You Need?
The standard advice: **3-6 months of essential expenses.**

Not 3-6 months of INCOME — 3-6 months of EXPENSES (rent, food, utilities, insurance, minimum debt payments).

**Example:**
• Monthly expenses: $3,000
• 3-month fund: $9,000
• 6-month fund: $18,000

**Who needs more (6+ months)?**
• Freelancers and self-employed
• Single-income households
• People in volatile industries
• Those with dependents

**Who can start with less (3 months)?**
• Dual-income households
• People with very stable employment
• Those with strong family support networks

Pro tip: Start with a $1,000 'starter' emergency fund. Then build to 1 month, then 3, then 6.

#### Quiz
1. What percentage of Americans cannot cover a $1,000 emergency?
   - A. 10%
   - B. 25%
   - C. 56% [Correct]
   - D. 90%

2. An emergency fund should cover 3-6 months of:
   - A. Income
   - B. Essential expenses [Correct]
   - C. Wants
   - D. Investments

3. A good 'starter' emergency fund amount is:
   - A. $100
   - B. $1,000 [Correct]
   - C. $50,000
   - D. One year's salary

### Lesson 2: Where to Keep Your Emergency Fund
Lesson ID: `lesson-15-2`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 30
Description: HYSA, money market, and T-bills.

#### Screen 1: The Rules of Emergency Fund Placement
Your emergency fund has THREE requirements:
1. **Liquid** — You can access it within 1-2 business days.
2. **Safe** — It cannot lose value (no stocks!).
3. **Earning something** — Don't let inflation eat it alive.

**Where NOT to keep it:**
• ❌ Checking account (earns 0.01%, easy to accidentally spend)
• ❌ Stock market (could drop 30% right when you need it)
• ❌ Under your mattress (inflation + theft risk)
• ❌ Crypto (too volatile)

#### Screen 2: Best Options
**High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA):**
• Currently earning 4-5% APY (as of 2024)
• FDIC insured up to $250,000
• Instant or 1-day transfers
• Best option for most people
• Top picks: Marcus, Ally, Discover, SoFi

**Money Market Account:**
• Similar rates to HYSA
• May come with check-writing ability
• Also FDIC insured

**Treasury Bills (T-Bills):**
• Government-backed securities (4-5% as of 2024)
• Exempt from state/local taxes
• Can buy through TreasuryDirect.gov
• Slightly less liquid (must wait for maturity, 4-52 weeks)

Pro tip: Keep 1-2 months in HYSA for quick access, and the rest in T-Bills for a slightly higher effective yield.

### Lesson 3: Recovering from Financial Setbacks
Lesson ID: `lesson-15-3`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 35
Description: Job loss, medical bills, and rebuilding.

#### Screen 1: When Disaster Strikes
Financial setbacks happen to everyone. What matters is your response.

**If you lose your job:**
1. File for unemployment IMMEDIATELY (don't wait).
2. Cut all non-essential spending within 48 hours.
3. Contact lenders to request hardship forbearance.
4. Review COBRA vs. marketplace health insurance options.
5. Start job searching on day 1, but don't panic-accept a bad offer.

**If hit with medical debt:**
1. Audit every bill for errors (up to 80% of medical bills contain mistakes).
2. Ask for an itemized bill — charges often 'disappear' when you request details.
3. Negotiate! Hospitals routinely reduce bills by 20-50%.
4. Ask about financial assistance programs (most hospitals have them).
5. Set up a payment plan (usually 0% interest).

#### Screen 2: The Rebuilding Playbook
After the crisis passes, rebuild methodically:

**Phase 1 — Stabilize (Month 1-2):**
• Create a bare-bones budget (essentials only)
• Stop all non-essential subscriptions
• Build a mini emergency fund ($500-$1,000)

**Phase 2 — Recover (Month 3-6):**
• Resume minimum debt payments
• Rebuild emergency fund to 1 month of expenses
• Start investing again (even $25/month matters)

**Phase 3 — Strengthen (Month 6+):**
• Aggressively rebuild to 3-6 months reserves
• Review and update insurance coverage
• Create systems to prevent future crises

**Remember**: Financial setbacks are setbacks, not endings. Most wealthy people have faced multiple financial crises. The difference is they rebuilt each time.

#### Quiz
1. If you lose your job, what should you do FIRST?
   - A. Wait a month to see what happens
   - B. File for unemployment immediately [Correct]
   - C. Take out a payday loan
   - D. Sell all your investments

2. Up to what percentage of medical bills may contain errors?
   - A. 5%
   - B. 20%
   - C. 50%
   - D. 80% [Correct]

3. The first phase of financial rebuilding focuses on:
   - A. Aggressive investing
   - B. Stabilizing with a bare-bones budget [Correct]
   - C. Taking on new debt
   - D. Buying a home

### Lesson 4: Building Multiple Income Streams
Lesson ID: `lesson-15-4`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 40
Description: Don't put all your eggs in one paycheck.

#### Screen 1: Why One Income Is Risky
Relying on a single income source is like owning just one stock — all your risk is concentrated.

**The average millionaire has 7 income streams.** You don't need 7, but having 2-3 dramatically improves your financial resilience.

**Types of income:**
• **Active income**: Trading time for money (your job, freelancing, consulting).
• **Portfolio income**: Returns from investments (dividends, capital gains).
• **Passive income**: Money earned with minimal ongoing effort (rental income, royalties, digital products).

True 'passive' income usually requires significant upfront work or capital. But the payoff is income that doesn't stop when you stop working.

#### Screen 2: Realistic Side Income Ideas
**Low Barrier (start this week):**
• Freelancing your existing skills (writing, design, coding, tutoring)
• Selling unused items (eBay, Facebook Marketplace)
• Pet sitting / dog walking (Rover, Wag)
• Delivery driving (in a pinch, but low ROI long-term)

**Medium Effort (build over months):**
• Creating and selling digital products (templates, courses, ebooks)
• Starting a niche blog or YouTube channel
• Consulting in your area of expertise
• Reselling/arbitrage (buy low at clearance, sell on Amazon)

**Capital Required (invest to earn):**
• Dividend-paying index funds ($100+ invested → regular payouts)
• Real estate (house hacking: rent out spare rooms)
• REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts — like a real estate ETF)

**The key**: Pick ONE side income and give it 6 months of consistent effort before judging results. Most people quit too early.

#### Quiz
1. The average millionaire has how many income streams?
   - A. 1
   - B. 3
   - C. 7 [Correct]
   - D. 15

2. Which type of income requires minimal ongoing effort after initial setup?
   - A. Active income
   - B. Portfolio income
   - C. Passive income [Correct]
   - D. All require equal effort

3. How long should you give a new side income before judging results?
   - A. 1 week
   - B. 1 month
   - C. 6 months [Correct]
   - D. 5 years

## Module 18: The Fed, Rates, and the Real Economy
Module ID: `module-16`
Description: Learn how policy rates move mortgages, car loans, credit cards, and Treasury yields.

### Lesson 1: What the Fed Actually Controls
Lesson ID: `lesson-16-1`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 35
Description: The federal funds rate, the dual mandate, and the policy toolkit.

#### Screen 1: The Fed in Plain English
The Federal Reserve is the U.S. central bank. Its two legal goals are called the **dual mandate**:
• Maximum employment
• Stable prices (low, predictable inflation)

The Fed does NOT set your mortgage rate directly.
What it does set is the **price of short-term money** in the banking system, primarily through its target for the federal funds rate.

#### Screen 2: How Policy Decisions Are Made
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets regularly to decide whether to raise, hold, or cut rates.

They watch:
• Inflation data (CPI, PCE)
• Labor market data (jobs, wages, unemployment)
• Financial conditions (credit availability, market stress)

In modern operations, the Fed also uses tools like **interest on reserve balances (IORB)** and **open market operations** to keep short rates near its target.

#### Screen 3: Why This Hits Your Wallet
When the policy rate rises, borrowing gets more expensive across the economy:
• Credit cards reprice quickly
• Auto loans and new mortgages get more expensive
• Business loans tighten

When policy rates fall, the opposite tends to happen.

Your job is to understand where you have **variable-rate risk** and how to protect cash flow before your payments jump.

#### Quiz
1. What are the Fed's two primary goals under the dual mandate?
   - A. Strong dollar and low taxes
   - B. Maximum employment and stable prices [Correct]
   - C. High stock prices and low unemployment
   - D. Balanced budget and trade surplus

2. Which rate does the Fed target most directly?
   - A. 30-year mortgage rate
   - B. Credit card APR
   - C. Federal funds rate [Correct]
   - D. 10-year Treasury yield

3. A Fed rate hike usually does what first?
   - A. Immediately lowers all consumer rates
   - B. Makes short-term borrowing more expensive [Correct]
   - C. Eliminates inflation instantly
   - D. Raises wages automatically

### Lesson 2: From Fed Rate to Mortgage, Auto, and Card APRs
Lesson ID: `lesson-16-2`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 40
Description: How monetary policy passes through to household debt.

#### Screen 1: The Transmission Chain
A simple chain looks like this:
**Fed policy rate -> money-market rates -> bank funding costs -> consumer loan rates**

Different products move at different speeds:
• **Credit cards**: often reprice fastest
• **Auto loans**: reset with market conditions for new loans
• **Fixed mortgages**: tied more to longer-term Treasury yields than overnight rates

Translation: not all debt reacts the same way to a Fed hike.

#### Screen 2: Mortgage Math That Matters
For a fixed mortgage, your payment is locked after closing.
For an ARM, your payment can reset higher later.

Even a 1% rate difference can add large lifetime cost.
Example: a $350,000 loan at 6% vs 7% can mean hundreds more per month and tens of thousands more in total interest.

Key habit: shop rate + points + fees together. A 'lower rate' with high fees can still be worse.

#### Screen 3: Auto Loans and Credit Cards
Auto loans are usually fixed for that loan term, but new-car financing offers rise/fall with market rates and credit conditions.

Credit cards are usually variable APR tied to prime rate, so hikes can hit quickly.

High-impact actions:
• Attack variable-rate balances first
• Request APR reductions with issuers
• Refinance auto debt only when total cost improves after fees
• Avoid stretching loan terms just to lower monthly payments

#### Quiz
1. Which debt product usually reprices the fastest when rates move?
   - A. Fixed-rate mortgage
   - B. Auto lease residual value
   - C. Variable APR credit card balance [Correct]
   - D. Paid-off car loan

2. What is a key risk of an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)?
   - A. Your loan balance automatically disappears
   - B. Monthly payment can reset higher later [Correct]
   - C. You cannot refinance ever
   - D. Your rate is fixed forever

3. When comparing refinance offers, what should you compare together?
   - A. Rate only
   - B. Rate, points, and fees [Correct]
   - C. Loan term only
   - D. Lender logo and online reviews only

### Lesson 3: Treasury Bills, Bond Yields, and Government Debt
Lesson ID: `lesson-16-3`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 45
Description: How rates affect Treasury yields and federal interest costs.

#### Screen 1: Why T-Bills Matter
U.S. Treasury bills are short-term government debt (typically 4 to 52 weeks).

Their yields are strongly influenced by Fed policy and money-market expectations.
As short rates rise, T-bill yields usually rise too; when rates fall, yields often decline.

For savers, T-bills can be a low-risk parking spot for cash with competitive yield.

#### Screen 2: Yield Curve Basics
The **yield curve** plots yields across maturities (3-month, 2-year, 10-year, etc.).

Normal curve: long-term yields > short-term yields.
Inverted curve: short-term yields > long-term yields, often signaling slower growth expectations.

Household relevance:
• Mortgage rates lean on longer-term yields
• Savings products react more to short-term yields
• Refinance timing depends on where your rate sits vs current long-term rates

#### Screen 3: Federal Debt Service and You
When Treasury yields rise, new government borrowing becomes more expensive.
As old debt rolls over at higher rates, total federal interest expense rises.

That doesn't create an immediate household bill, but it can shape future policy choices:
• Taxes and spending tradeoffs
• Fiscal room during recessions
• Political pressure around deficits

Macro takeaway: rates don't just change personal loans; they also change the government's financing burden.

#### Quiz
1. Treasury bill yields are most closely linked to which part of the market?
   - A. Short-term rate expectations [Correct]
   - B. Home prices only
   - C. Corporate dividends
   - D. Used car prices

2. An inverted yield curve means:
   - A. Long-term yields are higher than short-term yields
   - B. Short-term yields are higher than long-term yields [Correct]
   - C. All Treasury yields are zero
   - D. Only T-bills have positive yields

3. When government debt rolls over at higher rates, federal interest expense generally:
   - A. Falls
   - B. Stays fixed forever
   - C. Rises [Correct]
   - D. Becomes irrelevant

### Lesson 4: A Household Playbook for Rate Cycles
Lesson ID: `lesson-16-4`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 55
Description: What to do when rates are rising, high, or falling.

#### Screen 1: If Rates Are Rising
Priority is protecting monthly cash flow.

Checklist:
• Pay down variable-rate debt aggressively
• Build or top up emergency savings
• Delay non-essential financed purchases
• Stress-test your budget with +10% higher required debt payments

Goal: reduce exposure before resets and repricing hit.

#### Screen 2: If Rates Are High but Stable
This is optimization mode.

Checklist:
• Lock in guaranteed returns on idle cash (HYSA, T-bills)
• Compare refinance offers carefully (APR + fees + break-even months)
• Keep investing systematically so you don't freeze waiting for perfect timing
• Avoid 'payment-only' decisions that increase total interest cost

#### Screen 3: If Rates Are Falling
Falling rates create opportunities, but not every refinance is good.

Use a break-even rule:
Break-even months = total refinance costs / monthly savings

If you won't stay in the loan long enough to pass break-even, skip it.

Final framework: build a simple debt dashboard with balance, rate type (fixed/variable), APR, and monthly payment so you can act quickly when rate conditions change.

#### Quiz
1. In a rising-rate cycle, what is usually the highest-priority household action?
   - A. Increase variable-rate debt
   - B. Pay down variable-rate balances [Correct]
   - C. Ignore your budget
   - D. Finance more discretionary purchases

2. Which formula helps decide if refinancing is worth it?
   - A. APR x income
   - B. Break-even months = total refi costs / monthly savings [Correct]
   - C. Savings / current balance
   - D. Rate spread x 12

3. A practical rate-cycle dashboard should include:
   - A. Balance, fixed/variable type, APR, and monthly payment [Correct]
   - B. Only your credit score
   - C. Only your income
   - D. Only your bank account balance

### Lesson 5: US Debt Crisis
Lesson ID: `lesson-16-5`
Type: interactive
XP Reward: 55
Description: Compare U.S. debt levels globally, review bipartisan overspending, and map out possible outcomes.

#### Screen 1: Debt Is a Long-Running, Bipartisan Issue
U.S. debt did not appear overnight and it is not a one-party problem.

Across Republican and Democratic administrations, the federal government has run repeated deficits.

Wars, recessions, tax cuts, demographic spending pressure, stimulus programs, and rising interest costs have all contributed.

#### Screen 2: How the U.S. Compares Globally
The dashboard compares U.S. debt-to-GDP to major peers.

At a high level, the U.S. debt burden is elevated, lower than Japan in this comparison, and above some other advanced economies.

Interpretation matters: debt levels, borrowing currency strength, growth, and interest costs all shape risk.

#### Screen 3: Three Possible Paths From Overspending
1) **Grow the economy faster than debt**
Higher nominal GDP can reduce debt burden relative to output.

2) **Lower rates / lower borrowing costs**
If rates fall, debt-service pressure on tax revenue can ease.

3) **Default on debt obligations**
This is the worst-case path and would likely trigger major market and economic disruption.

#### Screen 4: What to Watch as a Household
Debt headlines matter because they can influence taxes, rates, inflation pressure, and public spending choices.

Practical moves:
• Keep your own debt manageable
• Build emergency reserves
• Avoid relying on one policy outcome
• Focus on resilient long-term plans

#### Quiz
1. According to the lesson, U.S. overspending is best described as:
   - A. Only one party's issue
   - B. A bipartisan, multi-decade pattern [Correct]
   - C. A problem that started this year only
   - D. Completely unrelated to deficits

2. Which is generally considered the most severe outcome among the three scenarios discussed?
   - A. Growing GDP faster than debt
   - B. Lower borrowing costs
   - C. Default on debt obligations [Correct]
   - D. Maintaining stable tax revenue

3. Why does federal debt matter for households?
   - A. It only affects foreign governments
   - B. It can influence rates, inflation pressure, taxes, and policy choices [Correct]
   - C. It determines your exact paycheck next week
   - D. It has no connection to personal finance

## Module 19: Wealth & Impact
Module ID: `module-17`
Description: Giving, legacy, and the economics of philanthropy.

### Lesson 1: Giving and Legacy
Lesson ID: `lesson-17-1`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 40
Description: Understand non-profits, Donor Advised Funds, and how to maximize your charitable impact.

#### Screen 1: The Scale of Giving
Generosity has a massive economic footprint. In the United States, charitable giving consistently hovers around **2% of the total Gross Domestic Product (GDP)** every single year.

This equates to hundreds of billions of dollars voluntarily transferred from private citizens and corporations to organizations trying to solve problems.

This drive to give isn't just modern philanthropy. Many religions and cultures have built-in systems of giving. For example, **tithing** is the practice of giving 10% of one's income to a religious or charitable organization—a standard that dates back millennia.

#### Screen 2: How Non-Profits Work
When you donate, your money usually goes to a **501(c)(3) non-profit organization**.

"Non-profit" doesn't mean no one gets paid. It means the organization has no *owners* or *shareholders* who receive the profits. Any surplus revenue MUST be reinvested back into the organization's mission.

A healthy non-profit needs to spend money on:
• **Program Expenses:** The actual goods and services supporting the mission.
• **Administrative & Overhead:** Paying staff, renting office space, running the accounting.
• **Fundraising:** Marketing to bring in the next round of donations.

While you want overhead to be reasonable, starving a non-profit of administrative funds prevents them from hiring talented leaders to actually solve the problem.

#### Screen 3: Donor Advised Funds (DAFs)
For those looking to structure their giving, **Donor Advised Funds (DAFs)** have become incredibly popular.

Think of a DAF like a personal charitable savings account:
1) You contribute cash or stock into the DAF and get an **immediate tax deduction** for that year.
2) The money in the DAF is invested and grows tax-free.
3) Whenever you're ready (months or years later), you "advise" the fund to send grants out to your favorite charities.

They are beloved by donors because they simplify giving (one tax receipt) and allow you to separate the *timing* of the tax benefit from the *timing* of the actual charitable payout.

#### Screen 4: The Tax Angle for the Wealthy
While most people give purely out of generosity, the wealthy pair giving with a highly efficient tax strategy.

Instead of donating cash, wealthy individuals often donate **highly appreciated assets** (like stocks that have gone up 300% in value) directly to a charity or a DAF.

By doing this, they score a double benefit:
• They get an income tax deduction for the *full current market value* of the stock.
• They **never have to pay capital gains tax** on the 300% growth.

The charity gets the full value to sell tax-free, and the donor wiped out a massive tax liability. It's a win-win.

#### Screen 5: Effective Altruism
With thousands of charities asking for money, how do you know yours is actually helping?

A movement called **Effective Altruism** focuses on using evidence and careful reasoning to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible.

Organizations like **GiveWell** spend thousands of hours researching charities to find the ones that save or improve lives the most per dollar spent.

Instead of giving based on an emotional commercial, effective altruists seek out independently verified data—often discovering that a dollar sent to fund malaria medication or vitamin A supplements overseas prevents far more suffering than a dollar spent locally.

#### Quiz
1. What does 'non-profit' actually mean for an organization?
   - A. Nobody gets paid
   - B. There are no owners or shareholders who receive profits [Correct]
   - C. They cannot charge for services
   - D. They are run entirely by volunteers

2. What is the main advantage of donating appreciated stock instead of cash to a charity or DAF?
   - A. The stock becomes more valuable after donation
   - B. You avoid capital gains tax and still get a deduction for the full market value [Correct]
   - C. The charity pays you interest on the donation
   - D. It counts as double the deduction

3. What does the Effective Altruism movement emphasize when choosing where to donate?
   - A. Giving to the most well-known charities
   - B. Using evidence and data to maximize impact per dollar [Correct]
   - C. Donating only to local organizations
   - D. Giving equal amounts to every charity

## Module 20: Investing in Your Kids
Module ID: `module-kids-finances`
Description: Secure your child's financial future through smart educational investments and tax-advantaged accounts.

### Lesson 1: ROI of Education: Public vs Private, Degrees vs Trades
Lesson ID: `lesson-kids-1`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 35
Description: A high-level look at the return on investment of different educational paths for your children.

#### Screen 1: First Things First: Secure Your Own Oxygen Mask
**Before you invest a single dollar in your child's future, make sure your own financial house is in order.**

Just like on an airplane, you put your own oxygen mask on first. That means:
• Your own retirement accounts (401k, Roth IRA) are being funded consistently.
• You have an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses.
• High-interest debt (credit cards, personal loans) is paid off or under control.

Why? Because your children can borrow for college—but you **cannot** borrow for retirement. If you sacrifice your retirement to fund their education, you may become a financial burden on them later. The best gift you can give your kids is parents who are financially stable.

Once your foundation is solid, THEN it's time to build for your kids. Let's explore how.

#### Screen 2: Public vs Private K-12: The Real Math
The average cost of **private K-12 school** in the U.S. is roughly **$12,000-$16,000/year** for elementary and **$16,000-$25,000+/year** for high school.

Over 13 years (K-12), a family could spend **$150,000 to $300,000+** on private school tuition alone.

Now consider the alternative: what if that money were **invested** instead?

If you invested $15,000/year for 13 years at an average 8% annual return, you'd have roughly **$340,000** at the end.

**Public school** is funded by your tax dollars and is free at the point of entry. Many public schools deliver excellent outcomes, especially in well-funded districts.

The ROI question isn't 'Is private school better?' It's: **'Is private school $150,000-$300,000 better?'** For most families, the data suggests the answer is nuanced. A child's success depends far more on parental involvement, reading at home, and mentorship than on the name on the school building.

#### Screen 3: Bachelor's Degree vs The Trades
A **4-year bachelor's degree** costs an average of **$100,000-$200,000+** when you factor in tuition, room, board, and fees. On top of that, you lose **4 years of potential earnings**.

Meanwhile, **trade school** (electrician, plumber, welder, HVAC tech) typically costs **$5,000-$15,000/year** for 1-2 years, and many programs offer **paid apprenticeships** where you earn while you learn.

By age 22, a tradesperson may have:
• **4+ years of work experience**
• **$0 in student debt**
• **$50,000-$80,000+ annual income**

A college graduate at 22 may have:
• **$30,000-$100,000+ in student loans**
• **No work experience in their field**
• **Entry-level salary of $40,000-$55,000**

Over a lifetime, college grads earn roughly **$1.2 million more** on average—but averages hide enormous variation. An electrician earning $85K with no debt may build more wealth than a communications major earning $45K with $80K in loans.

The right path depends on the individual child's strengths, interests, and the specific programs available.

#### Screen 4: Master's Programs: When Do They Pay Off?
A **master's degree** adds another **$30,000-$120,000** in costs and 1-3 years of time.

**High-ROI master's programs:**
• MBA from a top-20 school (avg salary jump of $50,000+/year)
• Computer Science or Engineering MS (salary premiums of $15,000-$30,000+)
• Nurse Practitioner / Physician Assistant (required for the role, high demand)

**Low-ROI master's programs (on average):**
• General humanities MA programs
• Degrees from unaccredited or low-ranked programs
• Any program funded entirely by high-interest private loans

The key question to ask: **'Will the salary increase I get from this degree pay back the cost within 3-5 years?'**

If the answer is yes, it's likely a smart investment. If the math doesn't work, your child may be better off gaining work experience and letting an employer pay for the degree later.

#### Screen 5: The Bottom Line on Education ROI
Education is one of the largest investments a family will ever make. Treat it like one.

**Key takeaways:**
• Private K-12 can be valuable, but run the numbers against investing that tuition money.
• A bachelor's degree is not automatically the best path—trades offer excellent ROI for many careers.
• Master's programs should be evaluated on a cold cost-vs-salary-increase basis.
• The most expensive option is not always the best option.

Teach your children to think about education as an **investment with a return**, not just a checkbox on the path to adulthood.

#### Quiz

   - D. Which school has more students?

3. When evaluating a master's degree, what is the critical financial question?
   - A. Is the campus beautiful?
   - B. Will the salary increase pay back the cost within 3-5 years? [Correct]
   - C. Is the program prestigious?
   - D. Can I defer payments?

### Lesson 2: The Power of Starting at Birth
Lesson ID: `lesson-kids-2`
Type: interactive
XP Reward: 40
Description: See how a small monthly investment from age 0 to 18 can transform your child's financial future.

#### Screen 1: Small Amounts, Massive Results
What if you set aside just **$50 per month** for your child from the day they were born?

At an average annual return of 8%:
• **$50/month for 18 years** = ~**$24,000** (vs $10,800 if you just saved cash)
• **$100/month for 18 years** = ~**$48,000**
• **$200/month for 18 years** = ~**$96,000**
• **$300/month for 18 years** = ~**$144,000**

That $48,000 from just $100/month could cover **two full years** of in-state public university tuition, dramatically reducing or eliminating the need for student loans.

The secret isn't a large paycheck. It's **time + consistency + compound growth**.

#### Screen 2: Relieving the Burden of Student Loans
The average student loan debt for a bachelor's degree is roughly **$30,000-$40,000**.

Monthly payments on $35,000 in student loans at 5.5% over 10 years = roughly **$380/month** for a decade after graduation.

Now imagine if a parent had invested **$100/month** from birth. That ~$48,000 nest egg could:
• **Eliminate** the need for student loans entirely at many state schools
• **Cut loan amounts in half** at more expensive institutions
• **Cover living expenses** so the student can focus on academics instead of working 30+ hours/week

Instead of your child starting adulthood $35,000 in the hole, they start with a **head start**. That changes the trajectory of their entire financial life.

#### Screen 3: The Compounding Head Start
Here's what makes this so powerful: if your child doesn't need all the money for school, the remainder keeps compounding.

Let's say you invested $100/month for 18 years (~$48,000 balance), and your child only uses $20,000 for school. The remaining **$28,000** left invested at 8% could grow to:

• **$60,000** by age 28
• **$130,000** by age 38
• **$600,000+** by age 58

You didn't just help with college. You potentially seeded your child's **retirement fund** with a gift that cost you less than a daily coffee.

This is generational wealth in action—not from a trust fund, but from **consistent small actions over time**.

#### Screen 4: Getting Started: Practical Steps
You don't need to be wealthy to do this. Here's how to start:

1) **Open a dedicated account** (a 529 plan or custodial brokerage account—we'll cover these in the next lesson).
2) **Set up automatic monthly transfers** of whatever you can afford—even $25/month matters.
3) **Invest in a diversified, low-cost index fund** (like a total stock market ETF).
4) **Increase contributions** when you get raises, tax refunds, or birthday money from family.
5) **Don't touch it.** Let compound interest do the heavy lifting.

Remember: the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is today.

### Lesson 3: 529 Plans, College Savings & Proposed Trump Accounts
Lesson ID: `lesson-kids-3`
Type: reading
XP Reward: 45
Description: Tax-advantaged ways to save for your child's education and financial future.

#### Screen 1: What Is a 529 Plan?
A **529 Plan** is a tax-advantaged savings account specifically designed for education expenses.

Key benefits:
• **Tax-free growth**: Your investments grow without being taxed.
• **Tax-free withdrawals**: When used for qualified education expenses (tuition, books, room & board).
• **State tax deductions**: Many states offer a tax deduction or credit for contributions.
• **High contribution limits**: Most plans allow total contributions of $300,000+ over the life of the account.

Unlike a retirement account, **anyone** can contribute—parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends. Instead of toys for birthdays, ask family to contribute to the 529. Those gifts compound for years.

#### Screen 2: 529 Flexibility: It's Not Just for College Anymore
529 plans have expanded significantly in recent years:

• **K-12 tuition**: Up to $10,000/year can be used for private elementary and high school.
• **Trade and vocational schools**: Qualified programs are covered.
• **Apprenticeship programs**: Registered apprenticeships count as qualified expenses.
• **Student loan repayment**: Up to $10,000 lifetime can be used to pay off student loans.

**NEW (Starting 2024):** Unused 529 funds can now be **rolled into a Roth IRA** for the beneficiary (subject to rules like a 15-year account minimum and annual Roth contribution limits).

This eliminates the old fear of 'What if my kid doesn't go to college?' Now, unused education savings can become **tax-free retirement savings**.

#### Screen 3: Preparing Children for College Expenses
Beyond saving money, prepare your child to **understand** the financial side of college:

**Conversations to have before they apply:**
• 'Here's what we've saved and what we can contribute.'
• 'Here's what student loans actually cost over 10-20 years.'
• 'Let's compare the total cost of different schools vs. expected starting salaries.'

**Smart strategies:**
• Apply for FAFSA every year—even if you think you won't qualify.
• Target schools where your child will be in the top 25% of applicants (they'll get better aid packages).
• Consider community college for the first 2 years, then transfer to a 4-year school.
• Have your child work part-time or do co-ops—not just for money, but for résumé building.

The goal is a child who sees college as a **strategic investment**, not an entitlement.

#### Screen 4: Proposed Trump Accounts: Free Kickstarter Money
In recent years, there has been a proposal for government-seeded investment accounts for children, sometimes referred to as **'Trump Accounts'** or similar initiatives.

The basic concept:
• The government deposits a set amount (proposals have ranged from **$1,000 to $5,000**) into an investment account for every child born in the U.S.
• The money is invested and grows tax-free until the child reaches adulthood.
• Funds could potentially be used for education, homeownership, or starting a business.

**A note on the politics:**
These types of proposals often carry political branding, and that can make people dismiss them based on party affiliation. **That is a mistake.**

Regardless of who proposes it or what it's called, if the government is offering to put **free seed money** into a compounding investment account for your child, you should take it. Period.

Political feelings should never override financial common sense. **Free money that compounds for 18+ years is free money that compounds for 18+ years**, no matter whose name is on the policy.

#### Screen 5: Putting It All Together
Here's the action plan for investing in your kids:

**Step 1: Secure your own finances first.** Fund your retirement, build your emergency fund, eliminate high-interest debt.

**Step 2: Open a 529 Plan.** Start with whatever you can—even $25/month. Set it on autopilot.

**Step 3: Enroll in any government-seeded programs** if and when they become available. Don't let politics leave money on the table.

**Step 4: Have honest conversations** with your kids about the cost of education and the ROI of different paths.

**Step 5: Let time do the work.** Small, consistent investments from birth can eliminate or dramatically reduce the burden of student loans and give your child a financial head start that lasts a lifetime.

You don't need to be rich to build generational wealth. You just need to **start early and stay consistent**.
